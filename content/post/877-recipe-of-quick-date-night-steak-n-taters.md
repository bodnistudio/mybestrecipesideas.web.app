recipeinstructions:
- "First thing is prep. Dice your peppers. Wash, clean and dice your potatoes. Put potatoes in a pot of cold salt water. Next drizzle some of the red wine and marinade on both sides of steaks, and I mean drizzle! We don&#39;t want the meat drowning. Let sit for 3 hours. (Never cook a steak cold. We&#39;re letting it get to room temp while letting the wine and marinade absorb)"
- "(3 hours later) First thing get the red wine/balsamic mix with the sugar added boiling slightly, stirring occasionally.   That&#39;s all a &#34;reduction&#34; is, adding sugar and boiling out the water/alcohol so your just left with the flavor.  Now in a separate pan cook the bacon strips. Set aside.   Salt and pepper both sides of the steaks and put them in the same pan you cooked the bacon in with all that beautiful bacon grease, on medium/high heat. About 4 minutes on each side, depending on thickness. Mine were about an inch thick and 4 minutes will get them medium, medium well.  Remove from pan and let them rest off to the side."
- "Now in the SAME pan, add your drained potatoes, peppers and crumble the bacon into the mix. Add a tbsp of butter and a dash of salt and pepper. Cook until the potatoes turn a golden brown and soften.  Remove the red wine/balsamic from heat."
- "Spoon the potato hash into middle of a plate in as close to a circle as you can. Drizzle half of your reduction onto hash and also onto the open areas of the plate. Next- Slice steak against the grain, at a slight angle, into strips. Place it directly on top of the hash.  Now you&#39;ve got a plate of food Gordon Ramsey would be proud of! That deserves a Bon Appetite!"
