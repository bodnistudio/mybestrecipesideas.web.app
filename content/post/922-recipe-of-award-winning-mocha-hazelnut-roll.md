recipeinstructions:
- "I used a bread machine to kneed/proof the dough. If you&#39;re also using one, add all the dough ingredients in the order listed to bread machine. Then, run on the small dough setting. If you&#39;re doing it by hand, mix/kneed the ingredients for 10-15 minutes. Then, cover with a damp cloth and allow to rise for 90 minutes."
- "Preheat oven to 350°F."
- "After rising, the dough will still be fairly sticky. Dust a flat surface with additional 1/2 cup of flour and place dough from bread machine onto it. Using a floured rolling pin, roll out to a roughly 12x8-inch rectangle."
- "Add Jif spread to a small bowl and soften by stirring liberally. Pour spread across entire center of dough rectangle. Leave only about 1 inch of empty space on each side. NOTE: Spread will not cover every bit of the inside. Do not spread too hard or it will tear through the dough."
- "Starting with the 12-inch side closest to you, roll the dough tightly until a log is formed. Gently place the log in a baking dish and form into a ring shape."
- "Using your fingers, dampen the top of the entire ring with water and dust with 3 tbsp of sugar."
- "Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until a golden brown crust has formed. Allow to rest/cool for 30 minutes before serving."
