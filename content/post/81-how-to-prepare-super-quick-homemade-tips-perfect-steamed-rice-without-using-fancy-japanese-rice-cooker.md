recipeingredient:
- "2 cups rice"
- "2 cups cold water"
- "1 teaspoon vinegar"
- "1 teaspoon oil"
- "1 pinch salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the rice until the water is clear. (Normally takes 3 times)"
- "Add oil, salt, vinegar in cold water. Normally the rice /water ratio is 1:1. It depends on the type of rice. White rice like sushi rice or jasmine rice are 1:1; brown rice, red rice or wild rice should be 1:2 (1 cup of rice with 2 cups of water)"
- "Boil the rice by strong heat with cover on. Keep stirring every 2.3 mins to prevent rice from sticking in the bottom. You could see the water gradually drain out and some air holes being generated.(Normally after 7-8 mins)"
- "Turn down the heat when you start seeing those air holes. Keep the cover on the whole time and watch the water boiling in the air holes. Turn the heat off when you stop seeing water coming out from the air holes."
- "Keep the cover on and let it sit for 20 mins. The steam will heat up the center of the rice hence it’s important to keep the cover on the whole time during the cooking process. Mix the rice evenly after 20 mins. Voilà ❤️"

Multi-use cookers such as the Instant Pot are great ways to cook rice, steam, and slow cook using only one appliance. However, if you already own a rice cooker with a steam basket, you can still get multiple uses out of this appliance without an additional item taking up space. I have to say though, once I started using a rice cooker, I&#39;ve never gone back to stove top. The rice cooker is so easy and makes perfect rice and the best part… you don&#39;t have to watch it. One of my favorite ways to add flavor to rice is by either using a cooking liquid other than water (bouillon or broth is an easy alternative), or by stirring in some fresh herbs, dried fruit, peas, nuts, or other flavor and color boosters.
