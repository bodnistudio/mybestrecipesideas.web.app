<h3>Instructions to make Nickie&#39;s homemade chicken pot pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Start the night before you prepare this and wash and then marinade your chicken with the Italian dressing and salt and pepper then throw it the frige till you cook the next day..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pre heat oven to 400°.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cook chicken with the Italian dressing poured all over it until done.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			while chicken cooks, add 1/2 bag of peas, carrots, potatoes, cream of chicken soup, chicken broth, two big spoonfuls of sour cream all in a large pot.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Also add milk, butter, salt and pepper at this time..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Heat this all up to a boil, stirring frequently, boil long enough to heat it all up and then turn it down and keep it warm..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Next after you cook your chicken,  cut it all up to your desired size. I like nice, at least in inch size peices.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			After you take the chicken out of the oven, go by the directions on the box and spray your dish well with pam, line  your.dish with 2 of the crusts, use a fork and make some holes in the dough to avoid big air bubbles  (and let crust hang over the edges of your dish).
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the chicken to your mixture and stir it all up good. Let it simmer while your crusts cook.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Next pour mixture into your dish over the cooked crust.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Open the other box of 2 pie crust, and lay it across the top of the entire dish. Again, allow your crusts to overlay the edges of the dish all the way around,  and polk a few fork holes in those crust and put entire dish back in the oven and cook on about 400° until crust is golden brown.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			**I almost forgot, I like to brush an egg wash over the crust, it makes it look and taste better**.
