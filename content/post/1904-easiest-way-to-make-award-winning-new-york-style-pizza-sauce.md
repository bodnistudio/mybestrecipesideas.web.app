Be the first to review this recipe. This creates a slightly sweet, intense tomato sauce typical of New York-style slices. It&#39;s also good served with pasta. The overnight dough is easy to make—and stretch!—and the sigh-inducingly thin, crisp crust, perfectly simple tomato sauce and modest smattering of mozzarella cheese meld to create far more than the sum of its parts. Unlike Neapolitan pies, which generally use a simple, uncooked sauce of fresh or canned tomatoes and salt, New York by-the-slice pies use a more heavily seasoned cooked sauce.
