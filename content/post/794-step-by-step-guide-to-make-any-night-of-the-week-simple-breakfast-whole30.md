All you need to do is stay away from grains, legumes ( lentils, beans, etc.) soy, dairy, added sugars, and processed foods. There&#39;s a long list of foods that are off-limits, and unfortunately, it rules out standard breakfast. That eliminates many of your typical breakfast items like cereal, toast, bagels, waffles, and more. Once I discovered this delicious egg bake that&#39;s loaded with veggies and a little chicken apple sausage, I never looked back! While the program does not allow yogurt or cereal and milk, breakfast favorites like eggs, along with fruits and vegetables, are easy foods to lean on.
