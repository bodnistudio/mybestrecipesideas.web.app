In a small saucepan heat milk just until simmering. Taking tea in muffin form seems ideal for breakfast, and the warm spices of chai bring scented richness without heft. I&#39;ve made these dairy-free, but if you want to, you can easily use semi-skimmed milk in place of the almond milk, below. I used Celestial Seasonings coconut chai blend tea.

My very, very favorite is Bigelow Constant Comment. But lately, I&#39;ve also been loving the Spiced Chai and Vanilla Chai from Bigelow. My afternoon snack almost always includes a cup of tea. The spices in the cupcakes are the same spices used to make Chai Tea. Tea is not one of the ingredients although maybe you could substitute some of the liquid with Chai Tea.
