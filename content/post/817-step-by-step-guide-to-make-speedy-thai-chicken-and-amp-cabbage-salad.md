Had it with Shrimp Pad Thai. The chicken curry recipe prep is a breeze, and the final effect is deeply rewarding: a rich, not-too-spicy, yet-oh-so-flavorful thick coconut sauce that&#39;s brimming with ginger, garlic, and authentic Thai chicken curry flavor. Mix flour with salt and pepper to taste and dredge chicken pieces in this. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet.
