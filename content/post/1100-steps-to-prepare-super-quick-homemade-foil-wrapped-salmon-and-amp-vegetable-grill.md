- " Salmon fillet 200 g  4"
- " Frozen spinach 150 g  4"
- " Corn ear"
- " Butter 5 g  4"
- " Seasoning salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "(In advance) Slice the salmon fillet, sprinkle seasoning salt all over the salmon, including the bottom &amp; sides."
- "(In advance) Wrap it and keep in the refrigerator at least 2 hrs."
- "(In advance) Thaw spinach and squeeze the water out."
- "Peel the corn and cut into 8 portions. *The photos are multiple ears, but just 1 ear is enough for 4 servings!"
- "Prepare 8 foil sheets to wrap the ingredients. Make it double layers per serving."
- "Place the spinach, corn, salmon, and butter on the foils. The salmon fillet should be placed on top. The seasonings and melted butter make a good sauce to drip on the corn &amp; spinach!"
- "Wrap it by making some space above &amp; around both sides of the salmon. This is important to steam &amp; bake the salmon in a tasty way, so do not make it tight!"
- "Grill with low - medium heat for just 10 mins. If you see some smoke around the foils, that means the heat is too high, so make it lower."
- "Place it on the serving plate, wait 1 - 2 mins to enclose the flavor well, then open the double foils."
- "With this method even the middle of the fillet will be well cooked. Whole salmon will stay soft and take on the flavor of the seasonings. Corn &amp; spinach will also be cooked with great flavors."
- "If you have leftover vegetables, you can make an easy grill just like this! Just put a few butter pads on top. With or without seasonings to your taste!"
