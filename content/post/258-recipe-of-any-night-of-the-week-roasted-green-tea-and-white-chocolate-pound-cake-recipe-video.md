While pound cake has traditionally been made with a pound each of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour, I&#39;ve made some small adjustments for the best flavor (hello, vanilla extract!). My recipe has a soft, buttery crumb that&#39;s perfectly dense without being at all dry or crumbly and I think you&#39;re really going to like it! Soft and spongy green tea cake - full of flavor, and not too sweet.
