- " Olive oil or vegetable oil"
- " small to medium red bell pepper chopped into  pieces"
- " small to medium green bell pepper chopped into  pieces"
- " medium yellow onion chopped into  pieces"
- " garlic peeled and minced"
- " medium tomatoes seeded and cored and chopped into  pieces"
- " GOYA Sazon azafran or 1 Tablespoon achiote or 1 teaspoon crushed saffron threads"
- " unsalted chicken stock"
- " water"
- " long grain rice Uncle Bens"
- " frozen peas optional"
- " Cilantroparsleygreen onion chopped for garnish optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a 4 or 5 quart Dutch or French oven, preheat 1.5 Tablespoons oil (if using skin-on chicken, 2.5 Tablespoons if skinless) over medium high heat and sear the chicken in two batches, about 3.5 to 4 minutes per side, until each side has a dark golden brown crust on it. Set the chicken aside."
- "In the same pot, add 1 Tablespoon of oil and add your bell pepper, onion, garlic, &amp; tomatoes, and sweat your aromatics until the onion becomes translucent about 5 minutes. Then add the GOYA Sazon azafran or achiote (or saffron) and 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, stirring them in until you can see the azafran or achiote is evenly distributed throughout your sofrito (A term in many Latino/Hispanic cuisines for the savory flavor base made when you sautee a minimum of onion, pepper, and garlic in oil)."
- "Add the chicken back, along with any juices, as well as 2 cups unsalted chicken stock and 1 cup water, give it a stir, and cover the pot to bring the braise to a boil (8 to 10 minutes). When the braise hits a boil, turn the heat down to medium low and simmer, with the lid askew (open about 1 inch on one side) for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally."
- "Remove the chicken and set aside. Then turn up heat to medium, remove lid, and simmer, uncovered for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will reduce braising liquid a little and concentrate the flavors. Adjust seasoning if needed, and turn off the heat. Then put the chicken back into the pot."
- "At this point, get another 4 or 5 quart pot out for your rice. Put the pot on the burner, turn the heat up to medium high, pour in the 3 cups of rice, 2 cups of the braising liquid from the chicken (I either scoop it right out with a 1 cup measuring cup or ladle it out into a measuring cup, along with some bits of the sofrito), 4 cups of unsalted chicken stock, and ½ teaspoon kosher salt."
- "Stir to combine, taste the seasoning and adjust for salt if desired. You’ll want to cover the chicken back up with the lid while the rice cooks so it’ll stay warm."
- "Cover the pot completely until the rice comes to a boil (check at about 7 minutes), then give it a few gentle stirs, turn the heat down to medium low, and continue to cook for another 15 to 20 minutes, fully covered, until all the liquid has been completely absorbed for a good 3 or 4 minutes."
- "Turn off the heat, add the frozen peas to the rice, and fold them into the rice as you fluff it."
- "Plate the rice, then place desired amount of chicken on top, spooning a little bit of the braising liquid over both the chicken and the rice, and garnish with some fresh chopped cilantro/parsley/green onions if desired before serving. The chicken should have remained warm enough for serving, but if not, you can always put it on medium heat about 5 minutes beforehand."
