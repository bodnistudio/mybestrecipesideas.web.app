<h3>Steps to make Taisen&#39;s Mini Fruit Pies:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			If your using pre made pie crust,  set it out at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes.  Cover your workspace with some flour.  Roll out one of the pie crusts. I made mine a bit bigger to get more out of it..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Using a round cookie cutter, other object round or free hand cut circles out of the dough. If you don&#39;t cut all the way through,  take a knife and carefully finish it..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Spray your cupcake tin with cooking spray so they don&#39;t stick or you can use oil and flour..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pre heat oven to 350.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Make your egg wash with 1 egg and water. Mix well.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place the circles in the cupcake pan. Press firmly but don&#39;t pack it in to hard..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a bowl, add the fruit filling of your choice and any extra cinnamon or sugar or anything else you want. Mix well. Add this into the cups, but don&#39;t over fill. As you can see, I over filled but I liked them just fine !.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Now, taking the extra dough from the first pie crust, put it back into a ball shape, knead it and re roll it out. Taking a knife, cut strips to make lattice or you can do a full covering pie crust or even use different shaped cookie cutters for fun !  You will need to use some of the 2 nd pie crust for this as well..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Make your lattice or whichever top you choose. If using the strips like I did, trim excess ends when finished placing them.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Using a brush , coat each top with the egg wash , or if your like me and don&#39;t have one use your finger as long as it&#39;s clean !.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Put these in the oven uncovered for 30 minutes or until they are golden brown..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Serve later or right away. Enjoy !.
