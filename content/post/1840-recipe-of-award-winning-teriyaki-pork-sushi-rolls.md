- "150 grams Pork belly sliced thinly"

- "1 Mayonnaise"
- "1 Vegetable oil"
- " Thick fried omelette"
- "3 Eggs"
- "1 tsp Sake"
- "1 tsp Sugar"
- "1 pinch Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Coat a pan with vegetable oil, heat, and saute the pork and garlic. Add soy sauce, sugar, and mirin, and saute until the broth evaporates."
- "Crack an egg into a bowl, add sake, sugar, and salt, and mix thoroughly. Make the thick fried omelette with the mixture, and cut into 1.5 cm sticks (long and thin)."
- "Quickly blanch the spinach in salted hot water (not listed), drain in a sieve, rinse with cold water, and squeeze tightly."
- "Spread out a sheet of nori seaweed on a sushi mat, and spread out 1/4 of the sushi rice thinly and evenly on top. Leave about 4 cm of seaweed for the overlap."
- "Lay the egg, crab meat with a little space in between, and spinach at the front of the sushi roll. Squeeze a generous amount of mayonnaise in the space between the imitation crab and egg."
- "Add the teriyaki pork on top of the squeezed mayonnaise, and roll it up."
- "After rolling, wrap the roll in plastic wrap, and let sit for a while. I think it makes it more difficult for the roll to fall apart if you cut it through the plastic wrap."
- "I heard that this tastes great with mustard-mayonnaise as well. That sounds nice! This is a tip from COOKPAD user &#34;Mifu74&#34;."
