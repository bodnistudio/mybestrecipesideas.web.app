- "When the surface is soft set, fold it into thirds using chopsticks."
- "Push the folded egg to the far side of the pan. Spread some oil in the open space of the pan using the oil-soaked paper from Step 2. Press the bottom of the frying pan on the moistened kitchen towel again as in Step 3."
- "Pour in some beaten egg as in Step 4. Hold the rolled egg up a bit and tilt the pan to let the uncooked egg flow under it."
- "Repeat Steps 5 to 7 until all the beaten egg is used up."
- "Wrap the cooked tamagoyaki in a sushi rolling mat and leave it as-is for a while. The tamagoyaki is done. If you match up the edges of the mat to the corners of the tamgoyaki when you wrap it, the surface will have a clean spiral."
