I&#39;ve wanted to share a recipe for pastelón, a dish akin to lasagna that I love, for a while now. Just about everyone I know that tries it also loves it. Dominicans call fried plantain slices &#34;fritos&#34; or &#34;tostones&#34;. The main difference between bananas and plantains is that the former has more sugar and less starch, while the latter has more starch than sugar and has to be cooked before eating. A plantain&#39;s taste depends on how ripe it is - the riper, the sweeter.
