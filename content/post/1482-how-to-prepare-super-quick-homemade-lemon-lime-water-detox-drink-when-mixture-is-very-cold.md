- "1 whole fresh lime"
- " Optional a pinch of ginger a pinch of cinnamon bit of honey"
- " Optional a half of a cucumber"
- " Purified Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash your lemon and lime off, before you peel or cut off the skin or rind of your lemon. Be gentle not to cut or peel into the lemon, you just want to take off the outter skin. [You can leave it on, but l found it made my drink mix to bitter, so it&#39;s optional.]"
- "On a cutting board, cut your lemon in half, and then in half again."
- "Then take the wedges and cut them into little wedges again. If using pinches of ground or shredded ginger, cinnamon, or honey to taste, then add these now."
- "Squeeze each little wedge and pieces, and add all the juices of each fruit, into your pitcher or infused bottle of choice. I use a SIP SORBO sin BPA BPA free. This kind can freeze, because it is made with hecho con TRITAN."
- "Peel or cut off your lime skin, rind, if you wish. l cut mine off because of the bitter flavors they leave in the detox purified water. It is optional. If you like the bitter tastes, then you can leave the skin on your fruits."
- "On a cutting board or cutting surface, cut your lime in half, and then in half again."
- "Take the lime wedges and cut them into little wedges or pieces again."
- "Squeeze each little wedge and all of it&#39;s juices and pieces into your drinking bottle of choice. If using a cucumber, only cut up half of the cucumber, and peel off or leave on the skin. Then cut into small slices, and add into drinking pitcher with the other fruits. I only use the fruits, and the purified water, when l make my mix. I drink my mix daily when l first wake up, then l wait a half hour to an hour before l eat anything to give my body the detoxing process."
- "Fill bottle or drinking pitcher up with purified or store bought bottled water. If you use a larger drinking pitcher of more than 63 fluid ounces, 1.86 liters, then you will probably need about 2 lemons and 2 limes cut up in your detox drink."
- "When finished with all the above steps, place bottle or drinking pitcher in the fridge, and leave it overnight. Drink in the morning or when you first wake up, before you eat or consume anything. I use this detox almost daily to rid my body of toxins, and excess weight. Doing this is better on my stomach than doing the hot lemon water detox. Please use as able or needed. Thank you."

Drinking your lemon water with a straw can help somewhat. In addition, I recommend you swish your mouth with clean water after drinking lemon water. To make lime water ahead of time, fill a pitcher with water and squeeze in the juice of a whole lime. Add lime slices to the pitcher for added flavor. For the best results, drink lime water without sugar or other additives.
