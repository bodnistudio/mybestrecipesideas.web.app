Besides the coconut cream and matcha, the secret of this green tea ice cream recipe is that we add some maple syrup, vanilla, and a squeeze of lemon. All of these help to cut through the natural bitterness that matcha (or any tea) has, and gives you a sweet ice-cream-y dessert.

This was the best green tea ice cream I have ever had. I have always disliked green tea ice cream until I had this one. But I changed the cream from dairy cream to coconut milk. I recommend doubling the matcha powder for tea lovers and adding an extra egg yolk..
