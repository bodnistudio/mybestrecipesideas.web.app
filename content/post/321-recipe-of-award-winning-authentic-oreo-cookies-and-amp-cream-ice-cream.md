recipeingredient:
- " Egg yolks"
- " Milk"
- " Heavy cream"
- " or to taste Granulated sugar"
- " Egg white"
- " Vanille essence or vanilla paste"
- " Oreo cookies"
recipeinstructions:
- "Divide the eggs into yolks and whites. Put 2 egg yolks and the granulated sugar in a bowl. Use a stainless steel bowl, since it will be heated later."
- "Whisk the yolks and sugar together well until it turns pale and thick."
- "Add milk to the mixture little by little, whisking vigorously as you drizzle it in."
- "Heat the bowl over very low heat. Keep mixing it up from the bottom using a silicone spatula until it&#39;s slightly thickened. Be careful not to burn yourself. If you&#39;re afraid to heat the bowl, transfer the mixture to a small pan first."
- "When the mixture has thickened, take it off the heat and cool the bowl in ice water."
- "Add 2 to 3 drops of vanilla essence. You can use vanilla paste instead."
- "Take the cream filling out of the Oreo cookies, and crush up carefully into small pieces, trying not to produce too much fine crumb."
- "Whip 1 egg white (about 30 g) and the heavy cream in separate bowls. Whip the meringue until firm."
- "Pour the halfway-whipped cream to the cooled egg mixture, and combine well."
- "If you have an ice cream maker, pour in the mixture, and start mixing."
- "Add the Oreo cookie bits about 10 minutes in. Don&#39;t add crumbs."
- "Add the meringue. Continue churning the ice cream following the machine instructions."
- "Transfer the finished ice cream to the freezer, and leave to rest overnight."
- "If you don&#39;t have an ice cream maker, put the mixture in a plastic freezer storage container and freeze."
- "Take it out every 40 to 50 minutes and mix it up thoroughly to incorporate plenty of air. Smooth out the surface and return to the freezer."
- "Add the meringue the 1st or 2nd time you mix up the ice cream. Repeat the mix-and-freeze procedure 4 to 5 times."
- "Add the Oreo cookie bits when you add the meringue. Mix well and freeze."
- "If you forget to mix the ice cream up according to schedule, it will form ice crystals and lose its creamy texture, so be diligent."
- "The ice cream is rested overnight in order to let the Oreo cookie bits become soft and moist."
