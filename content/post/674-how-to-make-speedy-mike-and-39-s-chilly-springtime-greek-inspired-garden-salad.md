Homemade salad dressings are always a hit when I share them on Five Heart Home. Here&#39;s another simple green salad recipe, this one starring leafy green kale! Raw kale can sometimes have a bitter taste. But with this flavor popping Italian-style dressing of lemon, Parmesan cheese, and garlic, the bitter taste of the kale is mellowed and melds beautifully with the other flavors.

Inspired by: McAlister&#39;s Deli Chef Salad. For a lot of the year, I can use my garden&#39;s produce when I make this cool salad. In spring, it&#39;s fresh greens and radishes, and in summer, we have tomatoes, cabbage and carrots. What a good feeling! —Evelyn Gubernath, Bucyrus, Ohio This classic salad dressing includes mayonnaise, anchovies, vinegar, green onion, garlic, parsley, tarragon and chives. It can be prepared in a blender or food processor and is good served as a dressing for steamed artichokes, a seafood salad, or as a sauce over broiled fish.
