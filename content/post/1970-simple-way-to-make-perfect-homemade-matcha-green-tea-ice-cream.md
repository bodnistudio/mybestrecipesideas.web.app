recipeingredient:
- "2 Tbsp matcha green tea powder"
- "100 ml heavy cream 45 fat"
- "80 to 100 ml milk or soy milk"
- "2 egg yolks"
- "6 Tbsp light brown sugar or white sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Beat the cream until becomes thick. (If you let some cream drip from the whisk, it should leave faint lines on the surface of the cream in the bowl.)"
- "Combine the sugar and matcha tea powder. This helps the matcha to dissolve easier in liquid."
- "Mix the egg yolks into the matcha and sugar."
- "Briefly heat the milk in the microwave until it&#39;s just about to come to a boil. Cool it down to about 60°C/140°F. (You don&#39;t have to use a thermometer - just make sure it&#39;s cool enough so that it won&#39;t cook the egg.)"
- "If a film forms on the surface of the milk, skim it off. Gradually add the milk to the bowl while mixing continuously."
- "Add the fresh cream and mix."
- "Strain the liquid. (It&#39;s not necessary, but straining will help the foam settle down and you can remove any undissolved matcha)."
- "Freeze. When it starts to set, take out and mix it up very well. Repeat two times. (Use a freezer-ready bowl to make this go easier.)"
- "The ice cream will taste best if you mix it up before it gets too hard from freezing - mix as if you are kneading. If it does get too hard, let it melt a bit at room temperature."
- "Done! I&#39;ve added some notes below so you can adjust the ice cream to your taste."
- "Even if ice crystals form in the ice cream, if you mix them in well, they will give it a nice accent to its creamy texture."
- "I used 3 tablespoons of &#34;Sarasara Matcha&#34; (a type of matcha for confectionaries) and unsweetened, unprocessed soy milk. Soy milk is lower in fat than regular milk, so it will make the ice cream taste lighter."
- "The ice cream will taste and smell a lot better if you make it with 2 tablespoons of high quality matcha - the kind that&#39;s used for a proper tea ceremony. The color will be darker."
- "The product called Sarasara Matcha has some dietary fiber mixed in, so it melts easily and is inexpensive. It does have the characteristic slight bitterness of matcha, but the fragrance and color are slightly weaker compared to the high quality kind."
- "You are really supposed to use 100 ml of milk, and reduce it down to 50 ml by simmering it. You can skip this process, but the ice cream does get icier. Still, I think it tastes lighter that way and you can eat it even when you just want a light snack."
- "I didn&#39;t add a lot of sugar so I could enjoy the bitterness of the tea. So if you prefer it to be sweeter, adjust the sugar amount to your taste. When the ice cream is frozen and set, you won&#39;t taste the sweetness as much."
