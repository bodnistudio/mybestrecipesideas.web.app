The first time I made the copycat recipe, it was a total hit. At the time I just used the recipe as is, so my kids did not eat it because of all the allergens it contained. The first version of the sandwich used grilled chicken with pita bread which was imported from the UK for the first week, then switched to local bakers. All work and no FReep make s Jack a dul boy. Patties: Mix salt, msg, pepper, and onion together in a shaker or small container.
