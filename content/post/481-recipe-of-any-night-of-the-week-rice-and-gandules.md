I&#39;ve made this with both and enjoyed each one. Pigeon peas are actually a bean used widely in Caribbean cooking. If you have a hard time finding them, you can substitute black eyed peas. Not to mention being dotted with gandules (pigeon peas) and alcaparrado (a salty brined mix of olive and capers).

It&#39;s cooked in a cast aluminum pan called a caldero. If you don&#39;t have one a large pot will do, however, a caldero will help achieve a crispy crust of rice at the bottom of the pot. Cilantro and other ingredients are whirred in the blender to create a seasoning base called soffrito used in this Latin rice and pigeon pea - gandulas - dish. Tomato sauce and soffrito impart a lovely flavor to the rice that is then cooked with the peas. Arroz con Gandules is the meal everyone in the Caribbean enjoys for the holidays or other celebrations with family and friends.
