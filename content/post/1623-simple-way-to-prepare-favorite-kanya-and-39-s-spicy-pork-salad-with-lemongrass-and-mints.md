I&#39;ve been able to find the fish sauce and lemongrass right in my local supermarket. Look for the fish sauce in the Asian foods aisle, and look for the lemongrass either in the fresh herbs section of your store, or in the general produce section. Lemongrass looks like thin, pale green stalks and it&#39;s generally sold in bundles of two or three.
