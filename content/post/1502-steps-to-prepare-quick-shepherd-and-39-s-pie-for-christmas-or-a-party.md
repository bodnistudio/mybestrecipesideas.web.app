		Shepherd&#39;s Pie comes to us from England, and is traditionally made with lamb or mutton.
	
		Regardless of what you call it, a shepherd&#39;s pie is basically a casserole with a layer of cooked meat and vegetables, topped with mashed potatoes, and baked in the oven until the mashed potatoes are.
	
		Shepherd&#39;s pie should only be named as such if it contains lamb, and &#34;cottage&#34; usually applies to one made with beef.
	
		The name &#34;cottage&#34; was applied to this kind of meat pie around the time potatoes were being introduced in the UK, because they were an affordable for thing for peasants, many of whom.
	
		Shepherd&#39;s pie is hearty, comforting dish with a savory meat filling topped with golden brown mashed potatoes.
