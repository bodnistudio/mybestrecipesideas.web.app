- "2 cups all purpose flour  additional for hands and work surface"
- "2 1/2 tsp. baking powder"
- "1 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon"
- "1/2 tsp. salt"
- "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter frozen"

- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1 heaping cup peeled and chopped apple"
- " coarse sugar optional"

recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt. Use a hand grater to grate the frozen butter and toss it into the flour mixture. Combine it with either a pastry cutter, a fork or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Set this bowl in the freezer for a few minutes. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a large baking tray with either parchment paper or a silicone baking mat and set it aside."
- "In a small bowl, whisk together the cream, egg, brown sugar and vanilla until well combined. Drizzle over the dry mix and use a rubber spatula to toss it all together until it&#39;s all just moistened. Then gently fold in the apples. The dough will be a bit wet and sticky. Flour your hands and a work surface, then use your hands to form the dough into a ball and transfer it to the floured surface. Press it into a disc shape, about 8&#34;. Use a very sharp knife to cut it into 8 equal wedges."
- "Place the wedges onto the prepared pan and set the pan in the fridge for 15 or so minutes. After that, brush the wedges with additional cream and sprinkle a little coarse sugar over each one. Then bake for 20-25 minutes, until they are golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on the tops. Let them cool for a few minutes, then drizzle them with the caramel sauce."
