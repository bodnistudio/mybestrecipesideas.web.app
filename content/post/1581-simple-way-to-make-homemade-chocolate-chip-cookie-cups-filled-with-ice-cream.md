- "1/4 tsp baking powder"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1/4 cup unsalted butter  1 stick  at room temperature  no subsitute for best tesults "

recipeinstructions:
- "In a large  bowl, beat butter, shortening and both sugars until light and fluffy, add egg and vanilla and beat in."
- "Combine flour with baking powder and salt in medium bowl, whisk to combine."
- "Add flour mixture to butter / sugar mixture and mix just until blended. Fold in chocolate chips."
- "Divide dough into 10 balls. Place on parchment lined platter and refrigerate until very cold, at least 2 to 3 hours."
- "Have ready regular standard cupcake tins. Turn cupcake tins upside down. Cover every other cupcake tin bottom with foil  liners, or cut foil to fit over bottom smoothly. Spray foil liners with non stick spray."
- "Preheat oven to 350"
- "Remove balls of dough from refrigerator and roll two  at a time between two sheets of parchment paper, to about 1/8 inch thick. Keep dough cold while rolling each group."
