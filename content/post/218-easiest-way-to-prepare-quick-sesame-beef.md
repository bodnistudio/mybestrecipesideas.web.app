The trick to this dish is cooking the steak quickly over high heat. Theirs comes with broccoli throughout the sesame beef and in the sauce. And the broccoli has a faint taste of the sauce also. Bill, it may be best to steam the broccoli first prior to adding it to the sauce, letting it warm and soak through. Of course, that&#39;s just my recommendation but as always, please.
