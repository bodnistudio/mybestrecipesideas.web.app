recipeingredient:
- "1 package phyllo dough thawed"
- "1-1 1/2 cup butter"
- "1-2 cup pecans or any other nut"
- "2-4 teaspoons cinnamon"
- "1 cup water"
- "1 cup sugar"
- "1/2 cup honey"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350 F."
- "Spread a layer of melted butter on the bottom of a 9x13 pan. Place 2 sheets of phyllo dough over it and spread them with butter. Repeat this process until you have 6-8 sheets layered."
- "Combine the nuts and the cinnamon."
- "Set aside about 8 sheets of phyllo dough, making sure to put a damp cloth over them. Repeat step 2, but sprinkle a small handful of nuts each time as well. Do this for your remaining phyllo dough. At some point, you may need to prepare more cinnamon nuts or melt more butter."
- "Once that stack of phyllo runs out, start layering with no nuts as in step 2 with the reserved phyllo. Be sure to butter the top well to prevent it from burning!"
- "Using a sharp knife (dull knives will tear it apart), trim the excess phyllo off the edges and cut the baklava. You can cut it in squares, triangles, diamonds, and probably more, but I usually go with squares for simplicity."
- "Bake for 35 minutes or until golden brown - keep an eye on it, as it can go from light brown to burnt within 5 minutes."
- "While it is baking, prepare the glaze. Combine the water and sugar in medium saucepan. Bring to medium heat. When the sugar is fully dissolved, add the honey and vanilla. Simmer for 20 minutes."
- "Pour glaze over baklava - it should bubble and boil and seep into it. Let cool."
- "Cut the baklava again, as the glaze can become slightly gummy as it cools. Enjoy! Optional: Transfer into cupcake liners for easier transport and eating."
