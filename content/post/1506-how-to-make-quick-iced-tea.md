##### The ingredients needed to make Iced Tea:

1. Take  teabags
1. Get  bicarbonate of soda
1. Take  boiling water
1. Prepare  cold water
1. Prepare  sugar


Use filtered tap water or spring water, if possible. When it comes to the tea itself, we&#39;ve found that loose-leaf tea produces a fuller-bodied tea, but tea bags will work in. Strong black teas are the traditional base for iced tea, but feel free to experiment. It&#39;s amazing what a tea bag can do.
