While it might be a relief to hear that KFC fires their chicken by hand, that doesn&#39;t exactly mean it&#39;s healthy: The Zinger burger, for instance, which is made with a fried chicken patty. KFC Coleslaw is one of my most personal childhood food memories. As a young kid I would walk from my elementary school with my great aunt and we would stop at KFC (then Kentucky Fried Chicken) to get a chicken plate to share and a pudding cup to share. Inspired by: Burger King Chicken Fries.
