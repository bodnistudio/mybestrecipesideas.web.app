For years I&#39;ve been on the hunt for the perfect stew recipe, and for years my stew has fallen short of the glorious meal it should be. I originally wanted to do a loaded potato soup with mashed potatoes, but thought that might be a bit too much potato for one bowl. Ultimately we settled on a hearty beef stew served over a mound of creamy mashed potatoes. Like an inverted Shepherd&#39;s Pie, if you will (and indeed, Shepherd&#39;s Pie Stew is the alternative name for this recipe).
