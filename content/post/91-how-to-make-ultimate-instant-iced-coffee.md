I had an urge for a Tim Horton&#39;s Iced cappuccino one day and found this recipe. I think it&#39;s awsome, but a litte tip of variation for iced cap lovers: Instead of putting the coffee and milk mixture in a glass of ice, blend it in with the ice in a blender, if you have an ice breaker. Instant coffee is manufactured by freeze-drying or spray-drying brewed coffee. The remaining powder or granulated crystals can be rehydrated just by adding hot water, and your coffee is ready. FILTER BY: It doesn&#39;t have to be summer for the iced coffee craving to kick into high gear, but when the temps creep up to triple digits, something chill to start the day seems just about right.
