Juicy strips of beef smothered in a sour cream mushroom gravy - a quick dinner everyone will love! KEY STEPS: Sear beef super quickly for maximum juiciness and use a large skillet (for quick sear + fast sauce reduction). Stroganoff calls for good beef but if you only have a budget cut, use this easy Chinese method to tenderise the beef (it&#39;s called &#34;velveting&#34;).
