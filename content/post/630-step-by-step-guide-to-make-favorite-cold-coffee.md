The finished glass of iced coffee should be frigid, not sorta cold with half-melted ice cubes floating around. Given the previous set of facts, one would assume that the logical solution would be to brew hot coffee, then transfer the brew to the fridge, allow it to cool, and use it to. Iced coffee is a type of coffee beverage served chilled, brewed variously with the fundamental division being cold brew - brewing the coffee cold, yielding a different flavor, and not requiring cooling - or brewing normally (hot) and then cooling, generally by simply pouring over ice or into ice cold milk. In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring are often mixed into the hot coffee before. Brewing your cold brew coffee in a French press makes the process easier, as it comes with a built-in plunger to filter the coffee once it&#39;s finished brewing.
