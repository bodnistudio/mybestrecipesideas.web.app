I feel like shortbread cookies are underrated. They&#39;re simple, admittedly a little plain looking, and not nearly as flashy as a stack. These crisp and buttery shortbread cookies are laced with vanilla chai tea leaves and then dipped in a vanilla spice icing for the full effect. Did you know that Chai just means tea, what we often think of as Chai here in the states is actually Masala Chai which originated in India and is made with black tea, Indian spices, milk, and sugar? Tea Shortbread Coins are the recipe to whip up when you want a simple and straight forward cookie where tea is the star of the show.
