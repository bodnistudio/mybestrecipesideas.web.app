<h3>Instructions to make Pumpkin Hand Pies:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Line a large baking tray with parchment paper and set it aside..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a medium bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice and vanilla extract. In a separate, small bowl, beat the egg. Set these aside..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Roll out your pie crusts and use a large circular cookie cutter (mine was about a 3.5 inch size) or the top of a drinking glass to cut out circles from the dough. Reroll out the scraps and continue to cut out circles to use up all the crust dough..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place half the dough circles on the prepared baking sheet. Place a spoonful of the pie filling in the center of each dough circle..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Working one at a time, dip the tip of your finger in water and run it around the edges of the dough circle. Then place one of the remaining dough circles on top and use your fingers to seal around the edges. Once you have all the top circles on, use the tines of a fork to crimp around the edges of each pie..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Use a sharp knife to poke 2 or 3 small holes in the top of each pie. Then brush the beaten egg over each one. After the egg wash, lightly sprinkle each pie with cinnamon sugar..

		<li>
			Bake the pies in the oven for 16-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Allow them to cool slightly before serving, as the filling will be quite hot. If you have any leftovers, store them in the fridge..
