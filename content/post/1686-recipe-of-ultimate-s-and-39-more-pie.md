<h3>Steps to make S&#39;more Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Preheat oven to 325°.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			add melted butter and graham cracker crumbs together until a crust forms. Press in to a 9 inch pie plate..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			combine milk and heavy cream in a saucepan and heat over low heat. Watch carefully and once it begins to simmer, remove from heat and add in chocolate. Stir with a spatula until chocolate is melted, then whisk in sugar and salt. In a separate bowl, lightly beat the 2 eggs. Slowly add eggs to chocolate mixture while whisking.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pour chocolate filling in to graham crust. Bake 30-35 minutes checking every 5-10 after 20 minutes.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			One the chocolate is no longer liquid, remove the tart and top with as many large marshmallows as you can fit. I heated my broiled on low, and stuck the pie back in for 2 minutes so the top could get golden. The other option is to just place it back in the oven for a few minutes until they melt or use a kitchen torch..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Let cool then refrigerate for 1-2 hours before cutting. Spray a knife with non-stick spray before slicing. If it is messy, just lift pieces out with a spoon. It’s just as delicious!.
