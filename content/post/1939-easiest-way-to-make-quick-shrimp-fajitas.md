Hello everybody, it is Louise, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, shrimp fajitas. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Shrimp Fajitas is one of the most popular of current trending meals on earth. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. It's enjoyed by millions daily. Shrimp Fajitas is something that I've loved my whole life. They're nice and they look wonderful.

This is a twist on a classic recipe using shrimp instead of beef or chicken. I use regular old taco seasoning to make it easier, but any seasoning combination for fajitas will work. Serve with refried beans and Spanish rice to make an easy meal!


To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can cook shrimp fajitas using 9 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

Spoon shrimp and vegetables into warmed tortillas; garnish with sour cream, cilantro and onion if desired.

The only tedious part is peeling the shrimp, but just about anyone in the family could help out there.
