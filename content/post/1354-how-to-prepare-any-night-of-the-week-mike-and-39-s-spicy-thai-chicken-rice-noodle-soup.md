About 35 to 40 minutes.                                                     ● Add additional chicken broth or water if you need it at simmers end. You&#39;ll definitely want a lot of broth for this dish.                                                                                                                         ● Turn off heat."
- "Prepare your chilled, fresh garnishments and place on table in seperate bowls."
- "● Pull your 1&#34; whole ginger piece and fine chop 1 tablespoon of it. Place back in pot.                                           ● I&#39;ll also add another handful of fresh chopped Thai Basil to the pot again and allow it to steep for flavor and texture."
- "Place room temperature rice noodles evenly in 4 seperate bowls. Try to slightly seperate noodles in bowls with chopsticks."
- "● Bring broth back up to a super heavy boil.                                            ● Ladle piping hot broth over the tops of your noodles.                               ● Mix broth and noodles well. The noodles will cook almost immediately.                                              ● Allow soup with noodles to sit for 1 minute before garnishing and serving."
- "● Know that even with your broths long simmer time, your snap peas and bean sprouts will still remain crispy.                                                                         ● Allow your guests to serve themselves from their noodles, to the broth, to their garnishes. They always seem to have great fun doing that! See the Garnishment section for options.                                                                                                                                                                            ● IMHO opinion as a Chef - additional fresh thai basil leaves, the squeeze of a lime wedge, Siracha Garlic Chile and Soy Sauce are absolutely essential - garnishment wise - in this soup upon serving. Enjoy!"
