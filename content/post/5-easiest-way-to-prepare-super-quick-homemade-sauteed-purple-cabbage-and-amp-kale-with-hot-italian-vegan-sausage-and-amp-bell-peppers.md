Red or purple cabbage is a viable option, but bear in mind that it has a much bolder flavor. You can also use leftover cabbage to make red cabbage casserole, beef cabbage stew or any of these other cabbage recipes. Gentle stirring will keep the carrots from turning purple. Red cabbage with apples is a traditional German side dish for pork roast and other roasts, Christmas goose, turkey, and game. It tastes even better when reheated so I usually make it the day before.
