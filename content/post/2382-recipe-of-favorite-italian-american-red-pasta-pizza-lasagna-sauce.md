Pizza and spaghetti with red sauce soon became symbols of the Neapolitan lively plebeian port culture. And while an Italian-American red sauce really does cook for hours, a more typical Italian tomato sauce, made either from fresh tomatoes or a very briefly cooked passata (pur√©e), spends much less time on the stove, resulting in a fresher, less deeply sweet flavor. In our recipe using fresh fruit, a sauce made from ripe plum tomatoes is. To adapt for the stove, use a large, deep sauce pot to saute the garlic and onion on low heat in olive oil until softened. Add the remainder of the veggies and saute for a few minutes.
