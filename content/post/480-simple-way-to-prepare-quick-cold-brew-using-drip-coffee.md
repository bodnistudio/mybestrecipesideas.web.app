Brewing temperature is, in fact, one of the most important factors for brewing drip coffee, (or any other brew type). It doesn&#39;t matter if you use a drip cone or the Technivorm coffee maker, this is the temperature water should have when it touches the grinds. And unlike hot-brewed coffee, which tastes drastically different after it cools, cold-brewed&#39;s flavor doesn&#39;t change, which means you can keep a stash in the fridge for up to two weeks. Due to the low temperature, the extraction rate is low, regardless of grind size.

An extra-coarse grind is best for cold brew coffee. As the brew method with the longest extraction time, cold brew coffee does not require as much surface area to fully extract flavor from the grounds. If you try to brew cold brew with a fine grind, you&#39;ll end up with a bitter, over extracted result even though you&#39;re using cold water. You&#39;ll just need some coffee beans (support your local roaster by ordering them online), a jar, and a cold overnight soak. Here&#39;s how to make Starbucks-style cold brew coffee at home.
