- " Char Siu ham or whatever you prefer"
recipeinstructions:
- "Point 1) Add salt and pepper or your choice of seasoning/flavor to the egg beforehand, and then beat well. Let it sit at room temperature. (The photo shows the egg mixed with doubanjiang, since I will be making Sichuan fried rice.)"
- "Point 2) Microwave the rice to evaporate the moisture and then spread it out in a bowl."
- "Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a frying pan. Use high heat! Don&#39;t mix the egg and rice."
- "Point 3) Once the frying pan has completely warmed up, add the egg to the rice and mix it together with a whisk very quickly. This should only take up to 5 seconds!"
- "Leaving the frying pan on high heat, add the rice and cook while breaking apart the clumps. After about 1 minute and after the rice clumps have been broken up, add the leek and char siu or other filling ingredients."
- "Point 4)  The cooking time should be within 2 minutes. If you cook it for too long it will become dried out. That&#39;s why you need to use high heat!"
- "Open up a whole in the center of the frying pan and pour in the soy sauce directly onto the pan to create a scorched aroma. Taste and adjust the flavor with salt and pepper. Add some green onion and give it a quick stir, then it&#39;s done."
