Put the rice in a pan with water to generously cover, and add the stock cube or powder. Lamb&#39;s subtly sweet gaminess works perfectly with the funky goodness of gochujang chile paste. The salt and sugar content of the simple Korean marinade acts as a brine for the lamb, producing a juicy interior when soaked overnight. In a food processor fitted with a metal blade add the garlic, rosemary, thyme, cayenne, and salt. Pour in olive oil and pulse into a paste.
