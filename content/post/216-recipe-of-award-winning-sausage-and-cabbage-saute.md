Salty, smoky sausage, with tender sauteed cabbage, is a guaranteed win with my family. While raw cabbage has very little flavor on its own and can even be a little bitter or peppery, cooked cabbage tastes sweeter and it picks up additional flavors from the foods you cook with it-for example, sausage. Add the green cabbage, remaining butter, paprika, salt, and pepper.
