I understand not boiling the kombu because it can affect the flavor, but can it just be added to the ramen bowl at the end and eaten? Freeze those used kombu pieces in a glass container and put away in the freezer until you have time or you have enough kombu to make Tsukudani.

In Japan, kayu rice porridge is the equivalent of chicken soup in times of sickness, a common remedy for colds and fever. It is a simple dish consisting of easily digestible soft rice and water.
