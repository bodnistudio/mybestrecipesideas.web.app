To use your frozen hash browns, simply cook like you would regular hash browns: Heat a good amount of butter in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the frozen hash browns in a thin layer. The key to crispy hash browns is to not pile them too high in the pan. Cook until dark brown and crispy on the bottom. Potato rosti requires the same ingredients, but you don&#39;t have to cook the potato first.
