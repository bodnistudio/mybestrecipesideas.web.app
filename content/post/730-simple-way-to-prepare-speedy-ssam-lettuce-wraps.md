Hello everybody, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, ssam lettuce wraps. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Ssam Lettuce Wraps is one of the most favored of current trending foods on earth. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look fantastic. Ssam Lettuce Wraps is something that I've loved my whole life.

Ssambap are Korean lettuce wraps made of boldly-flavored seasoned meat, rice, a zingy sauce called ssamjang, and crisp vegetables. Ssam means &#34;wrap&#34; in Korean, and bap means &#34;rice.&#34;Besides the rice and the wrap (lettuce most of the time), many variations exist when it comes to the filling of this tasty pocket. In Korean restaurants in the West, it&#39;s most popular to make ssambap with galbi.


To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have ssam lettuce wraps using 8 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Ssam Lettuce Wraps:

1. Get 1 lb bacon or
1. Take 1 lb stew meat sliced thinly

1. Prepare 3 green onions
1. Get 4-5 garlic cloves (minced)
1. Prepare 1 1/2 tsp sesame seed oil
1. Take 1/2 tsp sugar


Technically, ssamjang is any sauce that&#39;s used for ssam. To make a wrap, I started with a piece of lettuce, piled in as much steak as I wanted followed by any assortment of the sauces. Put altogether, it was a symphony of flavors. The steak laid a beefy and savory foundation by which the sharp and fresh ginger-scallion dressing, sour and spicy kimchi, and tangy ssam sauce all found a welcome home.
