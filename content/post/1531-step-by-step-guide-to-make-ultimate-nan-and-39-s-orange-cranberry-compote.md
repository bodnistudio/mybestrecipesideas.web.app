recipeingredient:
- "2 cup water"
- "2 pints fresh cranberries"
- "3/4 cup sugar"
- "1 Zest of 2 navel oranges"
- "1 box orange gelatin 412 cup serving size"
- "20 oz can of pineapple tidbits with juice"
- "2 navel oranges"
- "1 cup walnut pieces"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place cranberries in a colander and rinse with cold water. Discard any white berries (not ripe), soft, squishy berries (over ripe), or icky looking berries."
- "Zest the oranges, getting just the bright orange outer layer, none of the white pith. Each will yield about 1 tablespoon of zest."
- "Place the cranberries in a medium saucepan. Add the water, sugar, and orange zest and stir to combine. Place on high heat, bring to a boil, and cook on high heat for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook another 5 minutes."
- "Remove the cranberry mixture from the heat when done cooking and add orange gelatin. Stir to dissolve."
- "While the cranberries are cooking, peel the oranges removing as much of the white pith layer as possible without getting all OCD and making yourself crazy."
- "Separate the orange segments and cut them into thirds. You want big, juicy orange bites in the finished compote! Set them aside."
- "Stir in the oranges and walnuts. Stir well to evenly distribute everything."
- "Stir in the canned pineapple along with its juice. Allow to cool (don&#39;t refrigerate) for 30 minutes."
- "When completely cooled, spoon into containers, cover and refrigerate. I like to make the day before I want it so it&#39;s very well chilled when served."
- "If serving this as a dessert, it&#39;s extra yummy topped with a big squirt of whipped cream and a maraschino cherry! You can also change it up a bit with a different flavor of gelatin. Grape is quite good."
