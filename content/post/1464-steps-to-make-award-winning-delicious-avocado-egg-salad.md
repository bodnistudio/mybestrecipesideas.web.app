Light and tasty avocado egg salad. It&#39;s basically guacamole mixed with jammy soft boiled eggs together. This salad is seasoned with lime juice, ground coriander, and garlic - they add refreshing flavor and cut through avocado&#39;s fattiness. Slightly runny egg yolk is yummy and also glues the salad - no need to add mayo!

Avocado egg salad takes your classic egg salad recipe and adds healthy avocado for a creamy, nutritious and tasty new recipe you&#39;re sure to love. Cover the eggs with water in a saucepan. Run under cold water and break off the shells. A few days later, I was making egg salad sandwiches for lunch and had the fantastic idea to use avocado to bind it together instead of traditional mayo. Not only was this version unbelievably delicious but the healthy fats in the avocado make this a much better option than the traditional mayo-laden version. â€”Shannon Dobos, Calgary, Alberta More Avocado Recipes.
