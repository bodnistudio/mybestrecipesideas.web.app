This sausage, leek and spinach quiche is packed with all your favorites for tons of flavor! It starts with an easy sweet potato crust that&#39;s topped with savory sausage, leeks and spinach in a creamy dairy-free egg mixture, then baked to perfection. Sweet potatoes trump their white potato cousins in almost every area of nutrition, which is a good thing since regular potatoes are not allowed on Paleo. Sweet potatoes will give this quiche even more fiber, since it&#39;s already getting some from the asparagus. They&#39;ve added some cheese in with the sweet potatoes to form the crust and give it.
