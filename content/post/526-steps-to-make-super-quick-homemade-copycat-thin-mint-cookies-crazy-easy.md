recipeingredient:
- "1 cup chocolate of choice see note"
- "3/4 tsp mint extract"
- "18 Ritz Crackers Approx"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt chocolate. You can use whatever chocolate you prefer - dark, semi-sweet chips, chocolate “coating” “confectionery” or “dipping” wafers or chocolate with a bit of coconut oil or shortening mixed into it. I used Wilbur dark chocolate wafers."
- "Melt via bain marie method, short bursts in the microwave or in a saucepan. I prefer the bain marie method - it&#39;s easiest to control and maintain the chocolate temp. I do not bother tempering the chocolate for this recipe."
- "Mix in ¾ teaspoon mint extract to melted chocolate. This might cause your chocolate to thicken up a little - depending on what type of chocolate you&#39;re using."
- "Dip the Ritz crackers in the chocolate. I drop it in the bowl, gently flip it around with a fork and remove it carefully with two forks. Let excess chocolate drip off. If chocolate is too viscous, you might have to scrape excess off."
- "Place dipped cookies onto cookie sheet with wax paper."
- "Cool and store cookies in fridge. These cookies are best eaten straight from the fridge. Enjoy : )"
