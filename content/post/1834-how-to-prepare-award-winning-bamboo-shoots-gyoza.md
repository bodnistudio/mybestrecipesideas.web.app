Common flavours include ginger, garlic and chives. To give it a meaty umami flavour I used shiitake mushrooms and for a little more texture I went with bamboo shoots. Growing up in the US, bamboo shoots were a food you bought in a can, and aside from a passing acknowledgement that they were related to the tall green stalks that pandas eat, I never really put much thought into how they&#39;re grown or how they&#39;re prepared. One time, I found some fresh bamboo at a Chinese market and decided to try it out. Menma (Seasoned Bamboo Shoots) is a classic Japanese ramen topping but can also be enjoyed as a snack.
