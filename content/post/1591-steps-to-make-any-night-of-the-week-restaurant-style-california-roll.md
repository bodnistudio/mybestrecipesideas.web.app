recipeingredient:
- " Fillings"
- "1 Mayonnaise"
- "1 Masago capelin roe"
- "1 Nori seaweed cut in half"
- "1 Avocado"
- "1 packet Imitation crab sticks"
- "1 Mayonnaise"
- "1 Masago capelin roe"
- "540 ml Uncooked white rice"
- "1 tbsp Sake"
- "1 tbsp Mirin"
- "1 sheet Kombu seaweed 3 cm square"
- " Vinegar water"
- "30 ml Sushi vinegar"
- "30 ml Water"
- "1 pinch Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add sake and mirin to the rice when cooking, and use 1 mm less water than usual. Don&#39;t cook the rice using the &#39;sushi rice&#39; setting, just use the regular program."
- "Lay the kombu on top of the rice and switch the rice cooker on!"
- "Put the sushi vinegar ingredients in a small pan and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat off immediately."
- "Add the boiled sushi vinegar and water to the freshly cooked rice, leave to cool down a bit, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent from drying out."
- "Spread a piece of nori seaweed evenly with sushi rice. Slightly moisten your hands with water and flatten out the rice. Cover with plastic wrap."
- "Turn it over, wrap and all, so that the nori side is facing up. Draw a thin line in the middle with mayonnaise."
- "Top with avocado and crab sticks. If you put the avocado on the far side it may get mashed when you roll the sushi, so I think it&#39;s easier if you put the crab sticks on the far side and the avocado closer to you."
- "Fold the plastic wrap that is sticking out on the side closer to you under the mat to make it easier to roll the sushi."
- "Roll the sushi, and cut it with the wrap still on it. If you peel off the wrap with moistened hands, you won&#39;t get any sticky rice."
- "Put the masago on the cut sushi roll pieces to finish. If you don&#39;t like masago, use ground white sesame seeds instead."
- "How to cut an avocado Cut into the avocado lengthwise and you&#39;ll hit the pit. Slice all the way around the avocado."
- "Twist both halves with your hands and it will end up as shown in the photo. Cut into the half with the pit lengthwise again, and push out the pit."
- "Note: I cut each crab stick in half lengthwise. Adjust depending on how thick you want the crab sticks to be."
