Hello everybody, it is Jim, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, wheat flour pizza. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Wheat flour Pizza is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It is simple, it's quick, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions every day. They're fine and they look wonderful. Wheat flour Pizza is something that I've loved my whole life.

I have already shared the regular veg pizza recipe where the base is made from all purpose flour aka maida. This time I am sharing whole wheat pizza dough. This recipe will give light, fluffy pizza crust with crisp edges.


To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook wheat flour pizza using 13 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Wheat flour Pizza:

1. Get 1/2 cup wheat flour
1. Prepare 1/2 cup curd
1. Get 1/4 tsp baking powder
1. Take 1/8 tsp baking soda
1. Prepare 1/4 tsp salt
1. Take 2 tsp oil
1. Prepare 3 cup Salt for base
1. Take  Toppings
1. Take 1 cup chopped veggies (beans, carrot, potato)
1. Prepare as needed Mozzarella cheese
1. Prepare 1/2 cup Processed cheese
1. Get 4 tsp Pizza sauce
1. Get 1 tsp Mix herbs


To improve the nutritional profile of pizza, use half whole-wheat and half all-purpose flour, which yields a light crust with a distinctive nutty taste. Use a food processor, stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or your hands to mix the dough. When making pizza dough at home, the type of wheat flour you use may not seem like a big deal, but it will affect the dough. Of course, when making pizza dough, we want our crust to have some chewiness, but the choice of flour depends on the type of crust you&#39;re after, whether it&#39;s a thin New York-style crust, a chewy Neapolitan-style pizza, or a deep-dish pie.

White Whole Wheat Pizza Dough Recipe. This is a very adapted version of Peter Reinhart&#39;s dough using white whole wheat flour. All-purpose flour works well if that&#39;s what you have on hand. White flour, on the other hand, contains only the tissue inside the wheat seeds (also known as the endosperm), so is more malleable and ideal for pizza. Pivetti All-Purpose Italian Flour is the overall highest rated flour for pizza regarding price, quality, and crunchiness.
