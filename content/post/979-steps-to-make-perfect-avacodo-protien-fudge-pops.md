Personally, I prefer these over any store-bought fudge pop any day. Scoop the avocado flesh out from the skin and discard the skin and pit. Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into an ice pop mold. Run warm water over the mold to release the pops and store extras in a freezer bag.
