In a large skillet heat the olive oil. I made some Deep Fried Spaghetti! They turned out awesome, but after I finished them I realized that a much better way to make them would be to flatten all the noodles into a baking dish and then just cut out fry shapes. Bring a stockpot of water to a boil and salt it. This is a great pasta sauce to make ahead, dishes with tomatoes and spices &#34;meld and marry.&#34; as they sit and have even better flavor (like a chili recipe).
