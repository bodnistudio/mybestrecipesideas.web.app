On alpos ribs and chile thread (which looks absolutely fantastic) it looks like a lot more meat than beans (I like meat so I approve of this a lot), but I&#39;ve also had a look at a few recipes from foodnetwork and other places and it varies a lot. This classic red chili has chunks of stew meat and ground beef along with tomatoes, red beans, and spices. Fire-roasted tomatoes add a note of smokiness to the mix. If you can&#39;t find fire-roasted, use plain tomatoes and add a pinch of smoked paprika. By Lori Powell and Janis Jibrin, RD.
