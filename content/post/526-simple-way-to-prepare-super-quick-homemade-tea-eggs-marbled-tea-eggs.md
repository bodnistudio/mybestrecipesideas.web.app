- "Pour the cooled down marinade into the container or jar. Fill unti the eggs are completely covered. Place in the fridge and leave for 1 day. The longer the eggs are left in the marinade the deeper the flavour becomes. The eggs will last for 4 - 5 days in the refrigerator."
- "Gently peel the eggs to reveal the marble pattern. With a sharp knife cut the eggs in half. Serve on it&#39;s own as a snack, with a stew or in a ramen soup noodle. I go for a softer boiled egg as I prefer the Onsen-style glazed yolk!"
