Remove steaks from the pan and deglaze the skillet with the bourbon sauce. Rib-eye steaks are marinated in a sweet and savory bourbon whiskey marinade, then quickly grilled to smoky perfection for a New Orleans-inspired meal. Mixing the bourbon with a little maple syrup makes it easier to mix into the butter, plus the maple is a perfect foil for all the flavors going on in this dish. We ate these steaks with crispy Hasselback potatoes , prepared while the steaks were resting. Remove steak from marinade and season both sides with salt and pepper.
