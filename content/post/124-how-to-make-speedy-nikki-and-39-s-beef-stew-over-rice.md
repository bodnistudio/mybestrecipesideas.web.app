Stir in the tomato sauce, vinegar, oregano and pepper. im a butcher here, ive done this recipe a couple times with various tweaks here and there. the fastest (and tenderest) ive found is using beef tenderloin tips or (and i made this myself at work) cut up parts of tenderloin for the stew meat. searing at a high heat will brown the meat nicely and will cut out the long time to make the stew poriton.
