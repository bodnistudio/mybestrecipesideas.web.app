Remove from oven, brush with butter, place on cooling rack. If you have a shellfish allergy, you&#39;ll need to be extremely careful when dining out. You may want to avoid seafood restaurants entirely since people with severe shellfish allergies have had allergic reactions simply from breathing in particles of allergens from shellfish that is being steamed, fried, or boiled. I have a legitimate complaint, do not have access to the Internet because I&#39;m a senior and am having to ask my daughter to log a complaint because there is no venue for me to do so.

I should not be charged to give my opinion on the quality of the Campbell&#39;s Soup at Campbell&#39;s nor should I have had to waste my money on the bad-tasting soup. I couldn&#39;t tell you the first time I made this with my mom because I&#39;ve had my hands in it since I could walk. Add remaining ingredients (minus salt and pepper). As a girl who grew up eating gumbo, I&#39;m itchin&#39; to try this. There were rarely any veggies in our gumbo growing up besides green onionsâ€¦ just rice, roux, and meat (shrimp or chicken, none of that mixing meats nonsense in our house) so this will be a nice experiment and if I&#39;m halfway pleased, I may even try taking it home to mom and dad.
