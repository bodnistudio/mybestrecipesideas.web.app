recipeinstructions:
- "Chop your Thyme and Fennel in a blender. Then in a large mixing bowl, mix all meatball ingredients by hand until well blended. Tightly roll meatballs by hand the size and a half of a golf ball. Cover a cookie pan with tinfoil and spray lightly with Pam Cooking Spray. Place your rolled meatballs upon it. This recipe should yield 24 large meatballs."
- "Heat oven to 350° and bake meatballs 35 to 40 minutes."
- "Carefully transfer meatballs and drain on paper towels. Allow them to sit and firm up for 10 minutes."
- "In a large pot, add all Red Sauce ingredients and allow to simmer for 1 1/2 hours stirring responsibly. Pull out your Bay Leaves at the end of the simmer."
- "If you want to use this recipe for Spaghetti, gently place meatballs in boiling Red Sauce and cover with sauce. Turn off Red Sauce and allow meatballs to sit fully submerged in the sauce covered by a tight lid. Do not mix or you&#39;ll chance breaking up your meatballs. When you&#39;re ready to serve, simply heat dish up in the same pot. If you must stir, use a large, wide spoon and gently lift meatballs from the bottom and turn. Serve on top of pasta noodles. Also, serve with fresh garlic bread."
- "If you&#39;re making Meatball Subs, gently slice your warm meatballs in half (as so they sit flat and balanced on your bread) and place them on top Provolone Cheese on your Hoggie Bread. Then ladle your Meatballs with your boiling Red Sauce. Top with Parmesan Cheese, peppers and Tabasco if desired. There&#39;s no need to submerge your meatballs in sauce if making Subs however, if there are any leftovers (which there never is!) they should be added to the sauce for an additional use."
