I am part Hungarian, part German and part Romanian, so we ate a lot of ethnic food in my house….probably because it was better for us and it was a heck of a lot cheaper than eating out! Hungarian Chicken Paprikash is a traditional Hungarian dish made from simple, real food ingredients. Succulent pieces of chicken are simmered in the most flavorful sauce, made with the best Hungarian Paprika with a cream base. Hungarian Chicken Paprikash is usually served with traditional dumpling-like noodles (Nokedli), which are similar to German spaetzle, or with any other noodles, or rice.
