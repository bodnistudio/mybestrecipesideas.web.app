I think strawberry ice cream works best with a drizzle of aged or reduced balsamic vinegar for some grown-up acidity. If you want to get even more Mix the ice cream in a bowl until somewhat smooth and fill the pie shell with it. In a large bowl mix together the softened ice cream with the orange zest and pour into pie plate.
