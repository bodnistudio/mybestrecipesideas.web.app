	<strong>[Vegan] French Toast</strong>. 
	This easy vegan French toast is delicious made with almond milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, maple syrup, nutritional yeast, and a little flour. You won&#39;t miss the eggs at all in this delicious weekend morning breakfast. My Vegan French Toast uses tofu instead of eggs and as the French Toast cooks in the pan, the custard starts to set a little and you end up with the same texture as you would if using eggs.
