Topped with a sticky, cinnamon-scented apple compote, we don&#39;t even need maple syrup. Make delicious, fluffy pancakes from scratch. Brown on both sides and serve hot. These pumpkin spice pancakes are everything you look for in a pancake — light and fluffy with crisp edges, plenty of flavor and easy to make. They aren&#39;t your typical pancake and I attribute it to the creamy addition of the pumpkin pie spice coffee creamer made by International Delight®.
