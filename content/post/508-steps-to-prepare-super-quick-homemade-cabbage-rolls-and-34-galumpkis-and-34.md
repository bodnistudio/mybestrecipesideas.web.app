Homemade galumpkis (stuffed cabbage or cabbage rolls) are so easy to make in a crock pot! Tender leaves of steamed cabbage are rolled around a tomato-y rice and beef mixture, then covered in a creamy tomato sauce and slow cooked to perfection. Galumpkies, also spelled Galumpkis, is a Polish cabbage roll that creates a hearty meal with minimal effort. Blanching the cabbage leaves, rather than boiling the entire heads of cabbage, cuts down on the cooking time and makes the leaves more durable for rolling. Both of my Grandmothers had different recipes for Galumpkis.
