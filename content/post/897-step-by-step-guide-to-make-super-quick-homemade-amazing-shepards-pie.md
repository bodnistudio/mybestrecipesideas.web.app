		But since I&#39;m Scottish, I thought I&#39;d give it a unique twist to suit my ancestral tastes.
	
		The use of lamb, the smoky, heather taste of Guinness® Draught (Irish, I admit), and the topping of sharp Cheddar and smoked paprika give this version its unique, smoky-sweet flavor. wow i&#39;m really glad you posted this recipe bc i&#39;ve been looking for a simple shepards pie recipe for weeks now but I couldn&#39;t find one I liked.
	
		I will deff. be making this sometime this week.

		Traditionally, shepherd&#39;s pie is made with lamb (hence the name).
	
		However, as the dish gained wider popularity outside of its native English homeland (where using beef would make this a cottage pie), beef became a common substitute, especially in America where it&#39;s more widely available than ground lamb.
	
		Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water.
	
		Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil.
	
		So, this is how you spell it: Shepherd&#39;s Pie.
