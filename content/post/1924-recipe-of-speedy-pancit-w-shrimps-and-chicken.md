I used to work in an office with many Filipino women who were amazing cooks - and this is the pancit that Cristy would always bring, at everyone&#39;s request! This is a stir fried noodle dish composed of shrimp, chicken, flour noodles, Chinese s. Transfer the chicken to a bowl to cool, and reserve the cooking liquid. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, discard the skin.

Tear the chicken into bite-size pieces and shred into thin strands. Add dry pancit canton noodles and cabbage. Lower heat to medium low and mix using a spaghetti spoon (much easier to maneuver than regular cooking spoon). To reheat, just microwave or heat in a skillet until warmed through.
