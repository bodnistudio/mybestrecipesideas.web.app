![Arabic Coffee, The Saudi Way](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/521/751x532cq70/arabic-coffee-the-saudi-way-recipe-main-photo.jpg)

Hello everybody, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to make a distinctive dish, arabic coffee, the saudi way. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Somehow I find the idea of saffron in my coffee just a touch decadent but very nice, :D. Unesco has ascribed the origins of gahwa to UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar. &#34;Serving gahwa or Arabic coffee is a very important aspect of hospitality in the Emirati and other Arab societies. Saudi coffee, or al-qahwa, is made from roasted coffee beans, which can be roasted lightly or heavily, as well as a mix of spices like cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, or saffron.

Arabic Coffee, The Saudi Way is one of the most favored of current trending meals on earth. It's appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it's fast, it tastes yummy. Arabic Coffee, The Saudi Way is something which I have loved my whole life. They are fine and they look fantastic.

##### The ingredients needed to make Arabic Coffee, The Saudi Way:

1. Take  arabic coffee
1. Take  ground cardamom, powder
1. Take  saffron


We have shared the Saudi Qahwa recipe below. Arabic coffee (or Turkish Coffee, as some people call it) is more than a drink in the Arab world. And it&#39;s much more so a way of life than it is in almost any other coffee-drinking nation (and we&#39;ve been to many). For Arabic coffee, the arabica beans are lightly roasted and lighter in color than what we see in North America.

##### Steps to make Arabic Coffee, The Saudi Way:

1. Put 3 cups of water in a pot and bring to a boil.
1. Add the coffee and boil over low flame. Turn the heat off after 5 minutes and leave the coffee to clear.
1. Pour the coffee into a kettle, leaving the coffee to settle in the pot.
1. Add in the cardamom and saffron to the kettle of coffee and boil once before serving


With the addition of cardamom, the coffee takes on a green hue (but it&#39;s not as green as Saudi coffee). Note: sometimes &#34;Turkish coffee&#34; and &#34;Arabic coffee&#34; are used interchangeably, but they are different. Arabic coffee is a very small amount of dark coffee boiled in a pot and presented in a demitasse cup. Particularly in Egypt, coffee is served mazbuuta, which means the amount of sugar will be &#34;just right&#34;, about one teaspoon per cup. However, in the Arabian Peninsula, Arabic coffee is roasted in such a way that the coffee is almost clear.
