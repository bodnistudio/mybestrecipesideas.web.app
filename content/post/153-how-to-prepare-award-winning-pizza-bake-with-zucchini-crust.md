The first test, I just made the zucchini fritters into the shape of a pizza and baked it. While they were good, they were too eggy and reminded more of a thin frittata than an actual pizza. Place zucchini mixture on the pizza pan, spreading out to the edges of the pan. Top with pepperoni and/or other pizza toppings. Drizzle a little EVOO (eyeball it) into the same skillet the onion and pepper were cooked in.
