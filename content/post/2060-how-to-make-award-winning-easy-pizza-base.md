- "It&#39;s should have grown in size now massively. Take the wrap off, Don&#39;t worry about it dropping and divide it into approx 150g sections (this will give you a 10&#39;&#39; pizza base). Put into own bowls, cover again and then leave for more hours."

- "When ready to use, sprinkle some flour on the side and drop the dough onto it. You now want to start to work you base. Push your fingers into the dough all the way around just before the edges of the dough. Then, once you have the crust shape, toss the base side to side whilst rotating in your hands. (Check YouTube for some good videos on this) It will start to expand so be sure to rotate as you are moving it. Get it to the size you want and you are good to go with your toppings"
- "Once your base is ready, you just need add your toppings for either a red or white pizza and then cook"
- "Cook at a very high heat in the oven or ideally in a pizza oven or kamado. If you have a pizza stone, get that in. It will cook quick and if you don&#39;t keep your eyes on the prize it&#39;ll burn. In the pizza oven/kamado you are talking 3-4mins in a regular oven maybe double"
