		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cover and cook on low for 4 to 4.5 hours. Do NOT remove the cover in this time. Just trust it&#39;s doing its thing. The edges of the cake should be starting to brown and crisp slightly when done..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			When ready to serve, use a handheld or stand mixer woth a whick attachment to whip the cream and powdered sugar (and optional vanilla) together in a large bowl until stiff peaks form. Or make ahead too and store covered in fridge until serving time..

			Serve the cake warm with a dollop of the whipped cream..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			NOTE: You could also use chopped walnuts instead of pecans, or simply omit nuts if there is an allergy or you do not like them. But they are a great textural element, adding an excellent crunch..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			NOTE: If the cake is done before it&#39;s time for dessert it is perfectly fine to switch to warm until you&#39;re ready..
