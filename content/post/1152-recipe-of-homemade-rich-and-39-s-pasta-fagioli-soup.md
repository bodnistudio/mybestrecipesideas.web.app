It&#39;s an old timey (we&#39;re getting real historically accurate here, folks) Italian peasant dish made up of simple and inexpensive ingredients, with pasta and beans (naturally) being the main attraction. Tomato sauce, cannelini beans, navy beans and ditalini pasta are seasoned with parsley, basil and oregano in this chunky soup.
