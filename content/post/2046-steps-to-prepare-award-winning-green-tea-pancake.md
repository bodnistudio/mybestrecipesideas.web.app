As an ingredient in these Matcha Green Tea Pancakes - the flavor is rich and savory. It&#39;s not too sweet and it keeps the pancakes hearty and dense.

Feel free to adjust the matcha pancakes recipe as you prefer-get down with your healthy self and halve the sugar if you please. I&#39;ve been struck by the green tea matcha bug.
