recipeingredient:
- "20 grams Marshmallows"
- "70 ml Milk"
- "2 tsp Unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "2 to 3 Additional marshmallows for topping"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the marshmallows, milk and cocoa powder in a large heatproof bowl, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and microwave for 1 minute."
- "Mix to melt everything together. If the marshmallows won&#39;t melt, microwave for another minute. Even if there&#39;s a little unmelted marshmallow left, we&#39;ll add more marshmallow later as topping so don&#39;t worry about it."
- "When the mixture has cooled down, put it in the freezer. In 30 minutes to an hour, it will be half frozen, so mix it all up well. Rip up the marshmallows for the topping and add in. Moisten your hands as you rip up the marshmallows to prevent them from sticking."
- "Freeze for another 30 minutes to an hour. When it&#39;s hardened, mix it up well and serve. It&#39;s melty and delicious. The freezing time varies depending on how warm the mixture was when you put it in the freezer, and how cold the freezer is."
- "Attention: Don&#39;t use a metal bowl in the microwave since it will spark and is dangerous. Use a bowl that can be used in the microwave or freezer, so that you can use the same bowl for all steps to save effort. I showed a metal bowl in the photos previously so I changed them."
- "Attention: If making double or three times the amount at once, use as big a bowl as possible, cover very loosely with plastic wrap, and microwave for a minute to start with and add more time by the minute if things don&#39;t melt properly."
