recipeingredient:
- "5 ripe tomatoes roughly chopped"
- "2 onions chopped"
- "2 small carrots chopped"
- "7 garlic cloves slightly smashed"
- "2 tbsp oregano"
- " chilli flakes"
- "1/2 tsp turmeric"
- " fresh cream"
- "50 ml tomato puree"
- "bunch spring onions"
- "bunch coriander leaves"
- "2 tbsp cooking butter"
- " salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the cooking butter in a pressure cooker. Don&#39;t let it brown too much."
- "Add the chopped onions and garlic to the melted butter and fry till the onions turn translucent."
- "Add the carrots. They need to stay in the pan longer because they have to soften considerably."
- "Then add the tomatoes to the mixture and fry till they start to come apart slightly."
- "Add the chopped coriander leaves, oregano, chilli flakes, turmeric and salt to the pressure cooker. Fry for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. After adding the salt, the tomatoes would start melting and start to give a saucy consistency to the mixture. Keep tasting everything to ensure the desired flavor is achieved."
- "Close the pressure cooker and let it cook for 10 mins (2 whistles). Let the steam escape in it&#39;s own pace and open the cooker to cool down the mixture."
- "After the contents have cooled, blend it in a mixer or using a blender. Now you can either strain the result in a soup strainer to remove the tomato seeds and skin that didn&#39;t get disintegrated (guarantees the smoothness usually associated with soup) or use the blended mixture as it is. I prefer to use the non strained version as it gives a thicker consistency and great texture without wasting anything."
- "Now pour the soup back into a pan. Add the tomato puree to enhance the tomato flavour and bring to a boil. Then add the fresh cream to make the soup thick and rich."
- "Finally, chop up some spring onions and mix it in. Serve with crisp croutons on top and grilled cheese sandwiches on the side."
