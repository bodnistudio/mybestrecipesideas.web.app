This holds true for rice in many forms after it is cooked and moist. It could be gluten free pasta, baked goods using rice flour, even Rice-A-Roni noodles. The growth rate though can vary quite a bit, as more moisture may spawn more bacteria. Even in what we could consider dry items - liked rice cakes sold at retail - bacteria is detected. Rice that is cooked and still warm does not cook well when making fried rice.
