Tres lechesâ€”or &#34;three milks&#34; in Spanishâ€”is just a very moist cake that&#39;s enriched with two forms of concentrated milk and rich cream. The full dairy and vanilla flavors are a favorite in the southern U. Try serving this cake topped with a fresh berry or tropical fruit compote. Simply translated to &#34;Three Milks&#34; cake, this is a fluffy vanilla cake that&#39;s been drenched in three different types of milk (in our case condensed, evaporated, and heavy cream, with just a drop of vanilla). &#34;Tres Leches?&#34; I said. &#34;Three milks?&#34; I&#39;d passed high school Spanish.
