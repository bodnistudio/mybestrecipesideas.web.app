recipeinstructions:
- "Begin with a large deep sauté pan or Dutch oven.  Put about 2 tbs of olive oil in pan on medium heat.  Sauté green onion, broccoli, celery, mushrooms, garlic &amp; pimento all together for 5 minutes.  Add 2 cups water, cover &amp; sauté 5 more minutes.  Add wine and rice.  Simmer 10 minutes and evaluate moisture level.  You want the consistency to be wet to allow rice to absorb when the mixture goes into casserole to bake.  Use your judgement to determine if you need to add the remaining water during this 10 minute cook time.  Preheat oven to 350°F."
- "While the casserole mixture is at a low heat simmer, begin your no cheese sauce."
- "No Cheese Sauce:  place the red bell pepper, the sweet onion, the cashews, and the nutritional yeast, salt, &amp; water into a vitamix or other high speed food processor.  Mix for approximately 2 minutes at high speed."
- "Add the No cheese sauce to the casserole mixture.  Remove from heat and stir mixture together evenly."
- "Scoop the casserole mixture into a large glass Pyrex casserole dish."
- "Prepare Topping:  crush enough of your favorite crackers to have 3 heaping cups.  I like to toss them into a large ziplock bag and crush to a crumb texture.  Pour into a bowl.  Add sliced almonds, poppy seeds, and olive oil.  Add salt to taste."
- "Spoon and spread topping over top of casserole.  Bake for 30 minutes at 350°F."
