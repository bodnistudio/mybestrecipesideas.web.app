My favorite part of the tart is the filling. Mix the vegetables together in the bowl, adding a splash of oil. Pile a little of the mixture on each pesto-smeared tart and top with two olives (if using). Break up the mozzarella and place little bits on top of each tart - this will make it gooey like a pizza. Grate over some Parmesan (if using).
