recipeingredient:
- "  Crust "
- "  15 graham crackers"
- "1/2 teaspoon sea salt"
- "3 tablespoons Granulated Sugar 45 ml"
- "70 g butter"
- "  Filling "
- "400 g Sweetened condensed milk 1 can"
- "4 Egg yolks"
- "  115 g Lime juice from 3 limes"
- "1 tablespoon Lime zest from grating the limes we just juiced"
- "  Whipped Top  Optional"
- "170 g Heavy cream"
- "2 tablespoons Powder sugar 30 ml"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start here if you&#39;re making the crust yourself. For a store-bought crust, skip to step 9"
- "Melt the butter and allow to cool."
- "In a large food processor or blender, combine the graham crackers, sea salt, and sugar."
- "Mix them up for around 30 seconds."
- "Add the butter and continue mixing it until it&#39;s uniform. If it looks really watery add another graham cracker or two."
- "For the pie, your pan should be ~20cm. If you have a pie pan or springform pan, then skip this step. Otherwise if you&#39;re using a cake pan, press aluminium foil inside to the edges. This will allow us to lift the pie out easier later."
- "Push your graham cracker mixture into the bottom and edge of the pan, and don&#39;t worry about getting your hands dirty :) Then put the crust in the fridge for 10 minutes. (Don&#39;t use cling-film on the top, or it will steam)"
- "Take out of the fridge, and bake at 190C (~320F) for 15 minutes ^3^"
- "Separate the eggs, and save the yolks. You can use the whites for something else later."
- "In your food processor/ blender blend the filling ingredients (condensed milk, egg yolks, lime juice, lime zest), scraping the sides every 5 seconds or so. (Until it&#39;s smooth)"
- "Wait for the crust to have cooled down from the oven, and then pour your filling on top of the crust."
- "Bake in the oven for 14 minutes at 160C (320F). When it&#39;s ready the filling will be a little jiggly, but not wet. Add a minute or two if necessary."
- "Remove from the oven, and allow it to cool for 10-15 minutes, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours (cover with cling-film in the fridge this time)."
- "At this point, it&#39;s ready to eat, but you can add the whipped cream topping as well for more deliciousness. (Recommended!)"
- "Mix the icing sugar and the cream in a bowl, and beat for several minutes until the cream is firm, and holds its shape when you remove the beaters"
- "Spread evenly over the top of the pie, and enjoy on a hot summer day ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¥§"
