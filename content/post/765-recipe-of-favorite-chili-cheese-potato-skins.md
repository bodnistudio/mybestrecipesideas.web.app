recipeingredient:
- "6 small russet potatoes about 3 in long select unblemished potatoes as we are using the skins"
- "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil"
- "1/2 tsp paprika"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/4 tsp pepper"
- "1/4 tsp garlic powder"
- "1 cup to 2 cup Chili I use leftovers from when I make homemade but you can use canned chili"
- "2 cup shredded cheese I like cheddar or pepper jack"
- "8 oz sour cream will not use all"
- "1 Optional  crumbled bacon or Oscar Mayer Selects real bacon bits for a shortcut"
- "2 tbsp sliced green onions or chopped chives  for garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Scrub potatoes clean, poke a few holes in each with a fork or knife tip. Place in microwave and cook until fork tender, usually 12 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine olive oil, paprika, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Set aside."
- "When potatoes are done let cool until they are easy to handle. Gently slice potatoes in half lengthwise being careful not to tear the skins."
- "Using a spoon carefully scoop flesh out of the center leaving behind about 1/4 in. intact on the skins. Again be careful not to tear the skins. (And let&#39;s not be wasteful. Save the scooped out flesh for another use like potato cakes, mashed potatoes or gnocchi.)"
- "Preheat oven to 450°F, brush each potato half with oil mixture, inside and out. Place skin side up on baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Flip flesh side up so our little &#34;wells&#34; are ready to fill and bake another 10 minutes."
- "Meanwhile reheat chili slightly in microwave. Warming the chili helps it spread out to fill the skins. Remove potato skins from oven. Fill each with about a tablespoon or so of chili (depends on how full you want them) and top with a small mound of cheese."
- "Return to oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. You can broil here, but only about 2 min for that and keep an eye on them so they don&#39;t burn."
- "Remove from oven, top each with a dollop of sour cream, green onions/chives and bacon if desired. Eat and enjoy!"
