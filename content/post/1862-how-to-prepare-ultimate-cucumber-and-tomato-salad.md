recipeinstructions:
- "Nip the tips off of your cucumbers. I prefer long, thin cucumbers for this recipe. Japanese cucumbers are ideal. Now, rub some salt into the skin of your cucumbers. This will score the flesh of the cucumber. Set cucumbers aside."
- "Remove the stems from your cherry tomatoes and rinse them. Lay them out on a cutting board. Holding the tomatoes down with your palm, carefully slice between your cutting board and your palm to halve the tomatoes. This is a bit of a sloppy shortcut. If you want to stay classy, cut the tomatoes individually for a much cleaner result, but this is just a quick salad to round out a barbecue, so we&#39;ll go the easy rout."
- "Now, to get a more interesting texture from our cucumber, we&#39;re going to beat it up a bit. Grab anything you&#39;ve got that&#39;s sturdy and has some wait to it (a mallet, or a rolling pin or something. Pound the cucumber along it&#39;s length, just hard enough to split it&#39;s sides."
- "Tear your bruised cucumber into random chunks."
- "Now, toss in your tomatoes."
- "Tear off a handful of fresh parsley and rip it up. Add it to the bowl."
- "We&#39;ll dress this salad in the bowl with the remaining ingredients. Normally, I would offer a little more specificity her on amounts, but this is a quick salad that doesn&#39;t need much seasoning, and the ingredients are very moist and come in various sizes, so amounts should be adjustable in order to not leave you with a bunch of extra vinaigrette in your fridge. I recommend adding the seasonings in the order listed, more or less."
