Hey everyone, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, french silk pie. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

French silk pie is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions daily. French silk pie is something which I have loved my entire life. They're nice and they look fantastic.

Repackage and refrigerate one half for another use. Delicious, creamy, and decadent French silk pie! This recipe is unique since it requires the eggs to be cooked rather than a traditional French silk pie recipe that uses raw eggs.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook french silk pie using 8 ingredients and 10 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make French silk pie:

1. Take 1 deep dish pie shell
1. Make ready 3/4 cup granulated sugar
1. Make ready 1/2 cup real butter, melted
1. Make ready 2 squares Nestlé unsweetened bakers chocolate, melted
1. Take 1 tsp vanilla extract
1. Make ready 2 eggs, beaten well
1. Take 1 Cool whip
1. Take 1 chocolate bar...Hershey, etc.


French Silk Pie features an Oreo cookie crust, rich and creamy chocolate filling, and is topped with homemade whipped cream and chocolate shavings! This French silk pie, however, is served in a traditional pie crust and has a much richer, smoother filling. (Truthfully though… you can&#39;t go wrong with either chocolate pie!) Use Heavy Cream Again for Whipped Cream Topping. You need heavy cream for the filling AND the whipped cream garnish on top. Pick up a pint of heavy cream or heavy.

This French Silk Pie is incredibly rich and chocolatey, but also light and fluffy. If you prefer, you can opt for a milder chocolate flavor by omitting the cocoa powder. For a less sweet pie, opt for solid dark chocolate. Add in a teaspoon of mint extract in place of the vanilla for a minty twist. Many French silk pie recipes call for raw eggs to make the mousse-like, silky chocolate filling, but this recipe calls for pasteurized eggs instead, eliminating any food safety worries or concerns.
