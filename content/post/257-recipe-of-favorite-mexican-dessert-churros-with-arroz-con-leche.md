He said, &#34;All I see is cinnamon.&#34; Put the water, rice, and cinnamon stick in a medium-size heavy saucepan set over medium-high heat. This simple rice pudding is made the traditional Mexican way, with both whole and evaporated milk and a touch of cinnamon. &#34;This recipe was the closest to my grandmothers style of arroz con leche,&#34; says MsMichelleBelle. &#34;All of the other recipes call for raisins. I also didn&#39;t add sugar, I used condensed milk. This recipe was easy and delicious!&#34; One of the most popular sweet desserts we have in our Mexican culture is the Mexican Rice Pudding &#34;Arroz con leche&#34;, which, as with the other candies or desserts I mentioned above, is all natural, easy to make and very delicious.
