recipeinstructions:

- "Lightly grease a baking dish, then layer up your potatoes into the dish."
- "Pour the cheese sauce over the top, cover with foil and bake at 160 C for 1 hour. Remove the foil and turn up the heat to 200 C and let the bake brown for about 20 mins. Check the potatoes are cooked through before serving."
