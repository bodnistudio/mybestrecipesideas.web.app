The fruit is to add sweetness and for a balanced nutrition. We are lucky in that most. The Don flashed that big smile of his and asked me if I knew what he was eating. I surprised him by saying, &#34;Sure, that&#39;s Guaje (GWA-heh), grows all over the place.&#34; I only knew this because Guaje, LEUCAENA LEUCOCEPHALA, was one of the most common roadside trees back in the Yucatan, where the Maya called it Uaxim (WA-sheem). In English it has a host of names, including Leadtree, White Popinac.
