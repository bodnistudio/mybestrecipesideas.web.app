Mexican spices (at my own home I would have used Caribbean jerk seasoning), saute&#39;d them until done, then added them to the rest of the recipe as written. Slowly pour olive oil through shoot while processor is on to incorporate. Fluff the couscous with a fork. In a hot pan, pour some cooking oil and fry the chicken pieces. Once done, remove from the pan; Use the same pan for cooking the remaining.
