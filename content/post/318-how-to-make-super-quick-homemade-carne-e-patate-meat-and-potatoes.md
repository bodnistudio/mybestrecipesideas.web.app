As I said before, the overall cooking time could vary depending on what type of meat cuts you have been using. Pasta e fagioli (Pasta and Beans) and pasta e ceci (Pasta and Chickpeas) and pasta con la zucca (Pasta and Winter Squash) are other typical Neapolitan dishes made with pasta mista. When making this kind of dish, you&#39;ll need to cook until the hardest pasta is al dente, so this will probably mean some of the other pasta will already be quite soft, and some may even fall apart, but that&#39;s OK.
