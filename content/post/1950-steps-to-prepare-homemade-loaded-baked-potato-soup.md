We may earn commission from the links on this page. A classic baking potato is the russet, which is one of the most starch-filled in the world of spuds. That starch is released as the potatoes cook in the broth, becoming part of the underpinning of a rich, thick soup. Remove potatoes from oven to cool. As potatoes cool, prepare soup by melting butter in a large saucepan, and sauté onion until light brown.
