The chapatti is a bit smaller and softer compared to our Kenyan chapati. Karak is Qatar&#39;s &#34;national&#34; obsession and the adventure bit is that it is served in no-frills i.e in small paper cups and there is no seating area next to most restaurants selling this typa tea, because the idea is to keep it as traditional as possible. soa news blog. menu. cooking classes More info about Centurion Hotel Kenya local restaurant. Every one of our meals is prepared freshly in our kitchen and served in our fully accessible restaurant or bar area. The African variation of chapati is not to be confused with the Indian chapati it is based on. However, like its origin, it is a staple of local cuisine and it is made in the same way; a combination of flour and water to form a dough, rolled out thin, but not as thin as a tortilla, and cooked over a hot flat surface.
