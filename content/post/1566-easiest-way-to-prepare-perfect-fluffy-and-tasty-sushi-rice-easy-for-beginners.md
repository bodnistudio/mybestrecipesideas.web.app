recipeingredient:
- "700 grams White rice"
- "5 cm square Kombu for dashi stock"
- "2 and 12 tablespoons  Sugar"
- "1/2 tbsp  Salt"
- "3 and 12 tablespoons  Vinegar"
recipeinstructions:
- "To prepare the rice: After rinsing the rice, strain and let sit for 30 minutes. Transfer to pot, and add a slightly less amount of water than when preparing regular white rice. Top with kombu, and cook."
- "Combine the ● ingredients, briefly heat, then dissolve the salt and sugar. If the rice is too hot, the sushi vinegar will dissipate, so cool down the rice first!"
- "If you are using a sushi rice tub, fill it with water, and leave for about 10 minutes before filling it with the rice. If you put rice in a dry tub, the wood will absorb all the moisture and the rice will become dry."
- "Form a mound of rice in the center of the sushi tub (or bowl), lifting the rice paddle laterally as you form it. Pour the sushi vinegar from Step 2 over the rice in a swirling motion."
- "Use the rice paddle to stir the rice in a cutting motion to evenly blend the vinegar into the rice. Fanning the rice during this step will give the rice a glossy finish."
- "Collect the rice along the edge of the tub, and cover with a damp paper towel or gauze for about 10 minutes. After that, it will be ready to be used."
- "Use this rice to make rolled sushi or chirashi-zushi. This is an eho-maki roll filled with salmon, mayonnaise, avocado, lettuce, and atsuyaki-tamago (a thick egg crepe)."
