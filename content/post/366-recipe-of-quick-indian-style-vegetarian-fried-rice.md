- " cardamon pods green and bruised"
- " ghee"
- " green peas"
- " cilantro chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "OK, cook the basmati rice. It&#39;s two to 1, people. Two cups water for every cup of basmati. So, 3 cups rice means 6 cups water, equaling 6 cups cooked. Set aside in open air to cool and dry a bit."
- "Melt the 3 tablespoons of coconut oil into a large wok on low. If you don&#39;t have one, you should get one as it is super versatile pan."
- "Toss in the carrots and mustard seeds, and let that simmer until the seeds start to crackle a little."
- "Ok, now toss in the nuts and dals. Let those toast (not burn; be careful) stirring intermittently another 5 minutes, and then toss in the chilis and salt."
- "Now let&#39;s make it interesting and add the curry leaves, turmeric, cumin, ginger, asafoetida, and bruised green cardamon. Note: Curry powder is a totally different thing; don&#39;t use it here. Also Note: Cardamon pods are barely edible, so you may want to pick them out after they&#39;ve simmered a while, if that&#39;s the way you roll. Simmer for a couple of minutes."
- "Now add in the ghee and peas and simmer for another 3 minutes or so."
- "Mix in the rice! Try to get it mixed thoroughly with gentle hands and only as much as necessary. You aren&#39;t out to make rice paste."
- "Now add in the cilantro (gentle hands), add more salt as needed to taste, and serve. Note: In fried rice, salt has a way of taking a few minutes to really bloom. As such, you may accidentally add more salt when you should have waited a moment for it to integrate, thereby making it salty. Don&#39;t be that guy; be patient."
