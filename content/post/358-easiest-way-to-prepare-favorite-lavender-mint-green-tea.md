Fresh, cool mint is blended with lavender, clary sage, and spearmint to evoke an uplifting and aromatic scent. Mint might be one of the best compliments to lavender tea. The Lavender flower is technically in the mint family of plants. That is where you get that slightly minty flavor that is present in regular lavender tea. Add in a nice mint, spearmint or peppermint do just fine, and you will accentuate the flavor of the lavender mintiness.
