		Libby&#39;s pumpkin pie was one of the first things I ever baked, and it remained a staple on our Thanksgiving dessert spread for several years.
	
		Since the filling calls for a classic mix of pumpkin pie spices, you can replace the individual spices with store-bought or homemade pumpkin pie spice.
	
		Adapted from the &#34;Libby&#39;s Famous Pumpkin Pie&#34; recipe printed on the back of Libby&#39;s cans of pure pumpkin purée, this recipe is a testament to the enduring power of classic desserts.
