![Fruit Salad](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/36c022b8b0890b09/751x532cq70/fruit-salad-recipe-main-photo.jpg)

Hello everybody, it is me again, Dan, welcome to our recipe site. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, fruit salad. One of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Fruit Salad is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It's appreciated by millions every day. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes delicious. They're fine and they look fantastic. Fruit Salad is something that I've loved my whole life.

A fruit salad has to be pretty darn good to actually get a name, and the venerable Waldorf salad is certainly worthy. Embellish this as you see fit, but I really like it best with just the four ingredients seen here. Things like dried cranberries can add a nice seasonal touch but, for me, the chewy fruit gets in the way of that addictive.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook fruit salad using 7 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.
