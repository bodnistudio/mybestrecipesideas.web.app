An affogato is an Italian coffee-based dessert. While Italians have enjoyed it for years at the end of a meal, it became more popular in North America as a beverage when Starbuck&#39;s put Affogato-style Frappuccino blended beverages on their menu. There are only two ingredients (gelato, espresso), but the combination is a brilliant play on temperature and texture: The hot, bitter espresso melts the gelato and creates a café crème-colored.
