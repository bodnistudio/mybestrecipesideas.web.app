recipeingredient:
- "100 ml Yuzu citrus juice"
- "3 tbsp Sugar"
- "540 ml Uncooked white rice"
- "1 small piece Kombu"
recipeinstructions:
- "Juice the leftover yuzu after you use their zest for something else. Remove the seeds, and put into a storage container. You can use the juice like vinegar. There are so many uses for this, such as in a dipping sauce for gyoza dumplings, in sweets, or cocktail drinks. You can also blend with other citrus juices such as lemon or orange."
- "Put the yuzu juice and sugar in a pot. Bring to a boil for a second, then turn off the heat. Then mix with a chopstick until the sugar is dissolved. The sushi vinegar is done!"
- "Rinse the rice, and cook in a rice cooker with the konbu seaweed and water. Use a little less water than you usually would for firm rice."
- "Spread the freshly cooked rice on a large plate, and mix with a rice paddle to evaporate the water. Sprinkle the sushi vinegar evenly little by little over the rice as you mix. The sushi rice is done."
- "We used the rice for hand rolls. This one has salmon in it. We fight over the delicious fillings."
- "This is a negitoro (fatty tuna and green onion)."
