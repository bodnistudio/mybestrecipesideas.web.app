Sausage rolls can be frozen for two or three months. Defrost sausage rolls in the refrigerator overnight, then let them reach room temperature before baking. Apply an egg wash to unbaked rolls and bake according to the recipe (they may need a little longer to cook through). The puff pastry rose nicely and was a golden brown, and the sausage was fully cooked.
