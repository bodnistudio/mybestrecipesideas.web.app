- "When the bread is baked, drop the pan onto your counter from a height to push out the steam, take the loaf out and cook on a rack to finish."
- "The crumb is finely textured, very moist and soft even the next day. It has a silky mouth feel. The bread doesn&#39;t get stale fast either. It&#39;s a substantial bread that fills you up."
