Brushed during grilling with a garlic-steak sauce and then topped with a beefy mushroom sauce, they&#39;re T-riffic! Porterhouse steaks could be substituted for the T-Bone. Excellent flavor combination in the Bacon-Mushroom Sauce. I did use a Sauvignon Blanc white wine in place of the Sherry just because I love that wine to cook with.

Either in a skillet or on a broiler cook steaks to your liking. A sizzling steak topped with a rich, bold sauce - a meat-lover&#39;s match made in heaven! A mammoth steak taken from the whole sirloin, this cut is the best of both worlds. Cook T-bone steaks like the Italian bistecca - season generously and grill over a barbecue or griddle pan for about seven minutes on each side. T-bone Steak is one of the best steak cuts and includes a T-shaped bone with meat on each side.
