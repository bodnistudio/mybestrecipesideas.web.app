Once it begins to bubble, drop the heat down to med-low. Let this simmer for 5 minutes, stirring halfway to make sure the orzo isn&#39;t sticking to the pan. After the 5 minutes, stir in the spinach and place the lid back on for another 2-4 minutes, until the orzo is al dente. Then stir in the lemon juice, remove it from the heat and serve."
