Add the remaining heavy cream, then add the remaining Dulce De Leche. Cool *completely before filling with dulce de leche and topping with frosting. Once cooled, use a small sharp knife to carve out a small hole on the top of each cupcake. The size and depth of this hole is up to you, but I recommend not carving too wide or deep, since this may cause your cupcake to fall apart when bitten into. Easy Dulce De Leche Buttercream - is exactly that!
