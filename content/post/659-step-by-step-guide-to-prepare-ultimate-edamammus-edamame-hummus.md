##### The ingredients needed to make Edamammus (Edamame Hummus):

1. Make ready 2 cups pre-shelled edamame, cooked per package instructions
1. Take 1/4 cup light olive oil or vegetable oil
1. Get 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 medium lemons)
1. Get 1/4 cup water

If you want to make this without tahini, peanut butter is a great substitute and cheaper too! The word &#34;hummus&#34; is derived from the Arabic word for chickpeas, so this chickpea-free hummus is quite untraditional. To balance edamame&#39;s very green flavor and fibrous texture, I had to use a little more tahini, lemon juice and water than my go-to herbed hummus recipe. Combined with crisp veggies or whole-grain crackers, edamame hummus is a delicious, healthy snack or appetizer.

My favorite way to use edamame hummus is as a sandwich spread. I don&#39;t like mayo or mustard, so edamame hummus makes a great substitute. We had it on flatbread and topped it with roasted summer veggies for an easy weeknight meal. And of course, any kind of hummus is great as a dip for fresh vegetables, pita bread, or crackers. Made with protein-rich edamame instead of chickpeas, this easy hummus recipe is the perfect vegetarian filling for a grab-and-go wrap.
