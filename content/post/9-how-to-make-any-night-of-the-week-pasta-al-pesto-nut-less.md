- "6-8 cloves Garlic varies"
- "2 teaspoon black pepper"
- "2 teaspoon salt"
- "30 g Parmesan cheese"
- "500 g pasta of your choice"
- " Bacon bits Grilled Chicken"
recipeinstructions:
- "First wash your basil leaves and remember to remove any blackened leaves - this is so your pesto can last longer as I like to make the paste in large batch. In this first step, also - salt a big pot of boiling water with a splash of olive oil and pour your pasta in to cook."
- "Put the Basil leaves in a food processor/blender - whichever you have at home. Pour in the olive oil, pepper and salt. Blend lightly."
- "Peel the skin off your garlic cloves, and I would recommend to use a pestle and mortar to bruise the garlic before adding to the mixture, this would bring the garlic taste to the next level. After adding in garlic, pour in your parmesan cheese and continue to blend the mixture. These two are totally up to your taste. You can put more garlic or more cheese."
- "For the meat portion of the dish, generally you can grill a salt and pepper seasoned-chicken breast and then slice it to bite size pieces as a topping. Or in my case/version, I panfried my bacon (without any oil, I use the fat rendered from the bacon to complete frying the bacon bits).. and voila - you are done!"
- "Before draining your pasta, collect a cup of pasta water to create the sauce consistency."
- "Mix your pesto sauce onto your pasta and pour in that cup of pasta water and you will have a pan of Pasta la pesto... garnish with bacon bits. Or top it off with the bite-sized chicken breast."
- "Enjoy your meal with a refreshing pot of mint tea. I don’t know why, but that just does it for me."

Many of you made it, doubling the sauce to toss in some pasta. Note: The traditional way of serving pesto in Liguria, pesto&#39;s birthplace, is to prepare the pasta with green beans and potatoes, cooking them altogether in the same pot and then mixing them with the pesto sauce before serving. The starch of the potatoes lets the pesto cling to the pasta better. The fifth, pasta with homemade basil pesto, is a craving that arrives like clockwork every July. It usually comes with very specific instructions, a list of everything I think tastes good with, near, or stirred into pesto pasta, things like white beans, grilled and marinated zucchini, halved cherry tomatoes, and bocconcini (or tinier!) mozzarella. stefania&#39;s latest cookbook &#34;less is more&#34; My first cookbook supported my cooking classes.
