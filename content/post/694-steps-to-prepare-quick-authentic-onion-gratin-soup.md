- "Uncover and sauté for 5 minutes. *Scrape the brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan."
- "Cook for another 5 minutes."
- "Add the water, sake, and chicken consommé cubes (break up the cubes before adding), and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and adjust the saltiness. The soup base is done."

- "The reason for baking is to melt the cheese and brown the top; this could be done with either an oven or a toaster oven."
- "The baguettes that have absorbed the soup and the melted cheese on top taste amazing! I used small slices of baguettes and put 2 in each bowl."
