It is a sweet toasted flatbread. Vigan empanadas are also deep-fried, resulting in a crispy shell-like dough that&#39;s very different from the soft, semi-sweet dough used in other types of Filipino empanadas. Fillings vary but Vigan empanadas typically contain grated green papaya, mung bean sprouts, shredded carrots, skinless Vigan longganisa (Filipino sausage), and a whole egg.
