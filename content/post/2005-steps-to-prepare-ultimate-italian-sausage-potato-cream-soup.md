This creamy Zuppa Toscana recipe is inspired by the favorite Olive Garden soup, and full of Italian sausage, potato and kale. This flavorful, semi- lightened up cream soup is fairly simple to prepare and gets a lot of it&#39;s flavor from the Italian Sausage. I like to use Turkey Sausage to keep it a little more lean. You can add mild, spicy or sweet sausage too, it doesn&#39;t matter! ðŸ™‚ The sausage is added to sauteed carrots, potato, onion.
