<h3>Steps to make Delicata Squash Shepherds Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Heat 2 tbsp of coconut oil in a frying pan on medium-high heat. Let it get slightly hot, then add onions, celery and carrots. Stir and cook for about 10-11 minutes or until the onions are slightly translucent. Add the green chard and cook for another 5-7 minutes. Add the lentils, liquid smoke, mediterranean seasoning and tomato sauce to the veggies. Add another tbsp of coconut oil to keep the food from sticking to the pan. Cook for another 7-9 minutes. Set aside.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Clean and cube the squash. In small pot, put in the squash, water and bouillon then cook for approx. 20-30 minutes on medium heat. Check the squash with a fork. If it&#39;s soft enough to go thru the fork then it&#39;s ready. When it&#39;s ready pour half of the liquid out of the pot. Add the cooked mashed potatoes to the squash then start to mash the ingredients together. When it becomes a smooth mixture, stir until fully blended..

Set oven to broil. Broil the dish for 10-15 minutes or until the top is nicely browned. Bon Appetite!.
