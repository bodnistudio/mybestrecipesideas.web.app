recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 180째C/350째F. There is a saying &#34;people with cold hands are good at making pastry,&#34; so keep the butter in fridge until you need it. Prepare a bowl, add flour and butter. Mix them with your fingers, but do not knead the mixture."
- "When you get a crumbly, sand like texture, add water slowly until the texture becomes soft like your earlobe. Continue to mix, but do not knead."
- "Make a dough, and wrap it in plastic film and chill for a minimum of 30 min in the fridge."
- "Cut a pumpkin into small bite-sized pieces (about 3 cm cubes) and put them into a microwaveable container. Heat in a microwave for about 3 min until the pumpkin becomes soft."
- "Put the pumpkin pieces into a bowl. Mash them until it becomes roughly creamy in texture. Add sugar and keep mixing."
- "Pour the beaten eggs, the half cup of milk and double cream in the bowl. Sprinkle cinnamon powder. Mix well."
- "Roll out the pastry to about 2 mm thickness and then lay it into a pie tray. Shape the edge by pushing it with the tongs of a fork."
- "Pour the pumpkin mixture on the pasty. Bake for about 45 min. Let cool a little before enjoying this gorgeous treat!"
