It is an unusual dish as though the method is that of a cottage pie, the ingredients are very different using sausages and Paul explains. And can you ever deploy a sausage roll in a meal, the same way as you would a pie? (spoiler: no). The biggest mistake, however, is to treat the sausage roll as if it was a pie, using it as the centrepiece of a meal and pairing it with sides such as mash, chips, new potatoes, beans, carrots and peas. Cheesy mustard mashed potato resting on a layer of sausage and onions in a rich gravy - this truly is the ULTIMATE sausage pie! Roll the pastry sheets together and cut to line base and sides of prepared tin.
