Have you ever wanted to poop on people but were too shy to just go for it? There&#39;s poop in my soup lets you do just that, poop in soups.

I&#39;m At Soup, also titled as Soup Store (other variations of the title exist), is an animated meme in which two characters are shown yelling at each other over a phone call: Character A needs Character B to.
