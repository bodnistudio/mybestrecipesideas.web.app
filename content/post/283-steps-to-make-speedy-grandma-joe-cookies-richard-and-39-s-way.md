- " Icing"
- "2 1/4 cup Powdered sugar"
- "1/2 cup Hot water"
recipeinstructions:
- "READ ENTIRE RECIPEE BEFORE STARTING. These quanities of ingredients yield 60 cookies.  You may want to prepare only a &#34;half batch&#34;.  If using self-rising flour, omit the baking soda and salt ingredients.  Do not over-work mixtures in an electric mixer."
- "Cream shortening, gradually adding sugar. Set aside."
- "In anothet bowl, sift dry goods together."
- "Gradually add dry goods to creamed mixture."
- "In separate bowl, wisk molasses and coffee together."
- "Gradually add wet mixture to main ingredients.  Hold back a couple tablespoons of the wet mixture, to ensure correct consistancy is achieved."
- "Roll into 1/4&#34; thick.  May need to refrigerate for a couple hours if too sticky. Refrigerate 1/4&#34; dough for a couple hours to reduce stickiness, to more easily cut out cookie patterns. (Next time I&#39;ll just add more flour to try to lessen the stickiness, since the refigeration steps end up using the whole day!)."
- "Preheat oven to 400°F."
- "Once firmed, re-roll the chilled dough to 1/4&#34; thick. Cut out cookies."
- "Bake 9 to 10 minutes."
- "Let baked cookies cool on cooling rack."
- "Icing - slowly add powdered sugar to hot water in stovetop pot.  The ability to continuously reheat the icing is important, as it solidifies quickly during the icing process."
- "Using a &#34;candy funnel&#34;, apply molten icing to cooled cookies. Let set to harden."
- "Pack cookies carefully to protect damage to frosted tops!"
