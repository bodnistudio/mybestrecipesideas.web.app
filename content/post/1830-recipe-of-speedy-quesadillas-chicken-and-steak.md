Sure, I could sous vide a steak and make perfect hollandaise, but their former chef evidently made a pretty great quesadilla, and they wanted to see if I could live up to it. Quesadillas are a ridiculously uncomplicated dish: tortillas stuffed with cheese. Zesty chicken and cooked peppers are a tasty delight when mixed with cheese and stuffed in a tortilla to create chicken quesadillas. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the green bell peppers, red bell peppers, onion, and chicken.
