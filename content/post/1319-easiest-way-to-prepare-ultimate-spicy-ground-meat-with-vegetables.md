Remember that you don&#39;t necessarily need any meat to pull together a super-hearty stew or flavor-packed curry. Put vegetables at the center of your skillet with a mess of zucchini noodles you can serve with meatballs and marinara, or spaghetti squash as the star of a riff. My favorite trick for extending ground meat in recipes is to use vegetables or beans to replace half of the ground meat. This time I shredded vegetables, which mimicked the texture of the ground meat, but added a subtle sweetness and a whole lot of nutrition to the sauce.
