recipeinstructions:
- "Start by placing your dressing in the bottom of the mason jar. Pictured is my homemade ranch, but a vinaigrette will spread easier when you go to eat.

Place in the tomatoes, carrots, onions, radishes and broccoli florets, in that order."
- "Next, if you are using the diced, hard boiled egg or the diced chicken (or both) then place them in now."
- "Next comes the cheese, cabbage and lettuce. You may need to pack the lettuce in gently. At the very top, place the pepitas and sunflower seeds (if using). You could also place croutons in instead."
- "Place the lid on and refrigerate until you&#39;re ready to eat. Then, either shake it up and eat straight from the jar or dump everything into a bowl and toss around before eating."
