With this paleo sushi recipe, we&#39;ll skip the rice and use cauliflower rice instead. You might be thinking that rice is gluten-free and you&#39;d be correct. Finish off with a squeeze of lime and cilantro. *The texture should get &#34;sticky&#34; as the cauli-rice cools. As it warms, the texture will loosen. They don&#39;t call it Spanish rice either, it&#39;s just &#34;rice&#34; or &#34;red rice&#34; thanks to its rather recognizable color.
