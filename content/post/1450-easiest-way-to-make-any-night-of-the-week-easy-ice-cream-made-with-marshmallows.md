recipeingredient:
- "20 grams Marshmallows"
- "70 ml Milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the marshmallows and milk in a fairly large heatproof container and cover lightly with plastic wrap. Microwave for 1 minute."
- "Stir to dissolve the marshmallows. If the marshmallows don&#39;t melt, microwave for 1 more minute."
- "Let cool, then chill in the freezer. In about 30 minutes to 1 hour, the mixture will be half frozen. Mix well."
- "Freeze for another 30 minutes to 1 hour. When it&#39;s firm all the way through, stir it up again, and serve. It&#39;s creamy and delicious. (The freezing time depends on the temperature of the ingredients and your freezer.)"
- "You can add jam in the last mixing to make your favorite flavor. The one in the photo is blueberry."
- "Note: Metal bowls will spark if you put them in the microwave. Be sure use a container that is microwave and freezer-safe, so you can put the bowl directly into the freezer."
- "Note: If you double or triple the recipe, use a large container and cover lightly with plastic wrap. The microwave time is the same, one minute. If it isn&#39;t completely melted, microwave again, one minute at a time."
- "One person who tried it said that if you use soy milk and 1 tablespoon of powdered skim milk, it comes out really well."
