recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat 1 Tablespoon oil in a large pan to high, add chicken to the pan in a single layer. Let it cook undisturbed for 3 or 4 minutes on one side.  Then add salt and onion powder, redistribute chicken, ensuring that the uncooked side of each piece is touching the cooking surface, then cook another 4 or 5 minutes until all chicken is opaque and cooked through."

- "Then an optional additional sprinkling of mozzarella to hold the toppings in place once the cheese melts."
- "Bake for 15 minutes, switching racks halfway to make sure each pan gets the same type and intensity of heat exposure.  That&#39;s it! Enjoy. :)"
