recipeinstructions:
- "I find its always best to start this the night before. All you do is place the fruits and Peel in a bowl, then dissolve the sugar in the the hot tea and pour this over the fruits. Then cover with a cloth and leave to soak - as the fruits absorb the tea they become plump and juicy."
- "When you are ready to make the cake, preheat the oven to 170°C then place the pecans on a baking tray and pop them in the oven. Give them 8 minutes to toast but put a timer on as the burn very easily."
- "After they have cooled roughly chop the nuts. Now whisk the egg and add it to the fruits along with the toasted nuts and sifted flour. Give everything a thorough mixing. Add a tablespoon of milk and if the mixture still feels stiff, stir in another. Spoon the mixture into a prepared loaf tin and level with the back of a spoon. Bake on the lower shelf of the oven for 1 hour 10 minutes until it feels springy in the center."
- "When it comes out of the oven turn it out onto a wire rack to cool. Serve it cut in thick slices spread generously with butter."
