<h3>Instructions to make Key lime cheese pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			In a ziplock bag with a rolling pin or in a food processor grind the graham crackers and cookies down to crumbs. Add sugar, stir. Add melted butter and stir til all crumbs are coated and put into a pie dish. I use my trusty metal 1 cup measure, sprayed with Pam, to tamp down the crust. I do t like mine baked..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a large bowl, mix cream cheese and sugar with a mixer. Mix til smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk and key lime juice and mix til smooth. Pour into prepared crust and refrigerate for 2-3 hours OR put in the freezer for about an hour then put in fridge..

		Don&#39;t use a cheese grater to zest the limes.
	
		Use a zester and press gently when zesting so you don&#39;t get any of the white.
	
		This key lime pie filling has sour cream and sweetened condensed milk and is perfect for your favorite homemade graham cracker crust.
	
		I also used Rose&#39;s Key Lime juice.
	
		EDITED: I liked the combination of the oatmeal cookie crust with the pie filling, I just found the pie a little sweet.
