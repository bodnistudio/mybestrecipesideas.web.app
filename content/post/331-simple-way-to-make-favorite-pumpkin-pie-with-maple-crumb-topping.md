<h3>Instructions to make Pumpkin Pie with Maple Crumb Topping:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			For the crust, in a large bowl stir the butter, oil, sugar and salt together until evenly combined..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the flour (shifted), cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves and stir until soft dough forms. Do not overwork the dough. I did find that the dough was a little on the dry side so I added a 5-6 tbsp of cold water. If yours is a little dry add 1 tbsp of cold water at a time until you get the right consistency..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Shape the dough into a flat disk wrap with clingfilm and set in fridge for at least 30 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Roll the dough on a lightly floured flat surface until its about 12 inch in diameter..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Line a 9 inch pie plate/tray with the rolled dough. (I also buttered and floured the tray prior so it wouldn&#39;t stick).
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Fold the excess over the dough itself, crimping the edges to seal..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cover with plastic wrap and set in fridge until the filling is finished..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pre-heat the oven to 350 f/ 175 c/ gas mark 4..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			To make the filling, in a small bowl mix the sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger and cloves together..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a large bowl beat the eggs..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Stir in the puree and sugar spice mixture..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Lastly, gradually stir in the evaporated milk and add in the vanilla..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pour into the pie crust..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the filling is just about set. Mine did take slightly longer to just about set, about 35 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			To make the topping while th pie is baking, combine flour, sugar, butter and ginger in a food processor..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pluse until it becomes crumbly but do not over process as it will turn to dough..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Carefully add the topping to the pie and bake for another 30-40 minutes, until the crumb topping is golden brown..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cool on wire rack, until its at room temperature..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Refrigerate until it&#39;s time to serve..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add whipping cream or extra thick cream to each serving..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			I had a fair bit of dough and filling left so I made a few individual ones so as not to waste it..
			
			
		</li>
