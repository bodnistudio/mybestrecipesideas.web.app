I serve it with a fresh salad, warm bread, and with either mashed potatoes or pasta. The steaks make a very thin olive oil type sauce that can be used with the pasta. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. There&#39;s Speedy Pork Scaloppini for a fast family dinner and snappy, saucy Steak Pizzaiola that the boys absolutely adore. In a large pot of boiling, salted water, cook the linguine according to package instructions.
