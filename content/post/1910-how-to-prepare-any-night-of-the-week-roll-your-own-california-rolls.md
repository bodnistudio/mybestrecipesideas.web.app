- "1 Tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon juice"

recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the 2 cups of rice according to package instructions, fluff the rice and let it cool slightly (but not completely) before adding your sushi seasoning vinegar and mixing it thoroughly throughout the rice in a fluffing kind of motion. You don&#39;t want to stir to mix because your rice will turn into a gummy mess.  Set aside."

- "Cut your cukes and avos and set aside."
- "If you get the large gim or toasted nori, cut the sheets in half widthwise."
- "Lay it all out on the table and let people assemble, roll, and eat. It doesn&#39;t have to be a neat restaurant-style handroll roll. Just roll it up like a burrito and enjoy with wasabi and soy sauce and some sushi ginger if you like. :)  Alternatively, you can just make easy rice bowls with all the ingredients and either omit the nori or tear it up in small pieces and sprinkle it on top."
