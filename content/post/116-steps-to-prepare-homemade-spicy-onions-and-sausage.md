Hello everybody, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we're going to prepare a distinctive dish, spicy onions and sausage. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

I think every Italian family makes this dish, with slight variations of course, within their own family traditions. While this is a fairly standard way of making sausage and peppers, my family uses olive oil rather than butter, uses little or no herbs (fresh basil is always nice here), red wine rather than white, and some crushed or diced canned tomatoes, or marinara sauce. Slice the sausage lengthwise but not all the way through.

Spicy Onions and Sausage is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It's enjoyed by millions every day. It is simple, it is fast, it tastes delicious. They are nice and they look wonderful. Spicy Onions and Sausage is something that I have loved my whole life.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook spicy onions and sausage using 10 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you cook it.
