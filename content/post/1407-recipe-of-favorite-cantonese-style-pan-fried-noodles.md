Then cook for a couple minutes, grind some black pepper on top, turn some more, more pepper, cook for a couple minutes, keep this up until they appeared slightly dry with some crispy spots. Under done is better than over done in my opinion."

- "Use your tongs to constantly stir the noodles until they take a darker color evenly over all."
- "Add your meat/veggie mixture, continue to turn and mix, constantly. Now your goal is a good mix and heated through."
- "Turn off heat, serve. You can add some chopped green onion or parsley/cilantro for garnish if you desire."
