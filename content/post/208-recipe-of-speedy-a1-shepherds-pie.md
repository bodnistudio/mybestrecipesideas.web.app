Very different from the regular pub style Shepherd&#39;s Pie but still great! I didn&#39;t add thyme or rosemary but I did add Epicure&#39;s Roasted Garlic and Epicure&#39;s Beef and Pork seasoning. My family wasn&#39;t big on casseroles growing up and John and I aren&#39;t big on them now, but this recipe may be our one exception. Traditional Shepherd&#39;s pie contains ground beef, which I considered swapping for walnuts, a combination of mushrooms and walnuts, or lentils.
