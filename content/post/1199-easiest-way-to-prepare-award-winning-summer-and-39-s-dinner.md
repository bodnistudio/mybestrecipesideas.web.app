For a hearty vegetarian dinner, char fresh bell peppers, summer squash and shiitake mushrooms on the grill and serve on a bed of couscous with cool red pepper-yogurt sauce. Summer often means grilled dinners, and while there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, it&#39;s worth noting that the one-pan meals meal we loveâ€”made on one sheet-pan, in one skillet, a saucepan, or in a Dutch ovenâ€”are good options for seasonal meals, too. The one-pan dinners we turn to in warm weather are different than the baked casseroles or hearty stews that are our go-tos in fall and winter.
