I cut some of the fat in the beef by swapping half of it for cremini mushrooms and using my mom&#39;s burger-enhancing secret ingredient, Worcestershire sauce, along with steak spice to amp up the beefy goodness. Papa John&#39;s says the pizza and papadia &#34;feature a huge portion of seasoned beef, melty. Mix half of the flour mixture into the yeast water, and stir until no dry spots remain. Papa John&#39;s new, limited-time Double Cheeseburger Pizza features a pizza with &#34;zesty burger sauce,&#34; ground beef, diced Roma tomatoes, and dill pickles. The &#34;zesty burger sauce&#34; looked a bit like a bright Thousand Island or &#34;secret sauce&#34; but the taste is more mild, creamy, and savory with very light hints of ketchup and mustard.
