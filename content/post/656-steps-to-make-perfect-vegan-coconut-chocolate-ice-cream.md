recipeingredient:
- "2 (14 oz) cans full fat Coconut milk"
- "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon raw cacao powder sifted unsweetened cocoa powder is fine too"
- "1 tablespoon tapioca starch"
- "3/4 cup pure maple syrup"
- "1/8 teaspoon sea salt"
- "1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract"
- "6 tablespoon creamy almond butter unsalted or any creamy unsalted nut butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium saucepan, whisk together the coconut milk with the cacao powder, tapioca, and maple syrup. Heat the mixture over medium heat and cook while stirring with the whisk for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture just begins to bubble. Remove from heat, then whisk in the almond butter, vanilla and sea salt until fully combined and smooth."
- "Allow the mixture to cool at room temperature for about 20 minutes, stirring. A film might begin to form on top - this is normal, simply whisk to blend it away."
- "Transfer the mixture to a medium loaf pan (I used an 8.5 x 4.5} and cover the top with plastic wrap so the plastic is in full contact with the mixture. wrap again tightly with aluminum foil and place in the freezer, freeze 6 hours or overnight."
- "As with most homemade no-churn ice creams, once fully frozen, you will need to allow it to thaw on the countertop for 15-30 minutes prior to scooping."
