Japchae noodles is a Korean dish made with glass (sweet potato starch) noodles and vegetables. I have had glass noodle dishes before but never been served them by Koreans, so when our couchsurfing hosts in Gyeongu, South Korea mentioned that Japchae noodles would accompany the acorn jelly salad for dinner I was elated. When I had Korean glass noodles (Japchae / ChapChae) for the first time, I was blown away. The noodles were VERY chewy which made it very satisfying to eat, and the sauce didn&#39;t sit on the surface of the noodles or pool up on the bottom - it was absorbed into the noodle! Jap chae, or Korean glass noodles, is a very flavorful and nutritious dish that can be served as a main meal, snack or appetizer.
