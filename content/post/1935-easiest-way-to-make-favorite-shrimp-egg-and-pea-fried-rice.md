She suggests that day old chilled rice is the best. Chop green onions, keeping white and green sections separate. Heat half the oil in large wok set over high heat. Fried rice is traditionally made with leftover rice cooked a day ahead; this recipe simplifies the process by cooking the rice together with the rest of the meal. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
