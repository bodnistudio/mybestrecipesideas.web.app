recipeingredient:
- "1 lb ground turkey ground beef is fine"
- "1 small yellow onion  finely chopped"
- "1/4 cup carrots  finely chopped about 1 large"
- "1 tsp minced garlic 1 large clove"
- "1 tbsp dried parsley"
- "1 tsp dried oregano"
- "1/2 tsp dried basil"
- "1 bay leaf"
- "1 jar of your favorite spaghetti sauce or about 3 cups prepared homemade"
- "1/2 cup marsala wine or 12 cup beef broth  1 tsp white sugar"
- "1 salt and pepper to taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a deep sided 10 in. skillet over medium heat brown your ground turkey until no longer pink and little moisture remains, stirring constantly making sure to break up into a fine crumble. About 8 - 10 minutes. Note: If you are using ground beef drain fat when browned and return to skillet."
- "Still over medium heat add your chopped onion, chopped carrots and minced garlic to the skillet with meat and cook until onion begins to turn translucent, stirring frequently. About 4 minutes. Add all of your herbs, stir to combine and cook 1 minute more."
- "Increase heat to medium high. Add spaghetti sauce and wine (or beef broth mixture), stir to fully incorporate all ingredients. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low and simmer uncovered until sauce has thickened and reduced by almost half. About 15 - 20 minutes. When done, remove bay leaf, adjust salt to taste and serve."
- "To serve: While sauce is simmering prepare 8-12oz of spaghetti noodles according to package directions. Drain and let air dry for a couple minutes in strainer. Divide on 4-5 plates equally, top with bolognese equally until it is all used up, then freshly shredded parmesan. Serve with a crisp side salad and enjoy."
- "Note: I like biting into the little pieces of carrot and onion for a textural difference, but if you don&#39;t want the varying texture you can also roughly chop the carrot and onion then pulse in a food processor until very fine then continue with the recipe steps. This is also an excellent way to sneak veggies in for picky eaters. ;)"
