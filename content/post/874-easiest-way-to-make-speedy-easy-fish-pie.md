recipeinstructions:
- "Here are the basic ingredients, bathed in early morning sunshine. I made this pie in the morning and then popped it in the oven about 50 minutes before my parents arrived."
- "Poach the frozen fish for about 10 minutes until cooked through. Boil the eggs until hard boiled. Don’t overcook the fish - it will be finished in the oven later."
- "Slice the potatoes into discs about 5mm thick. Parboil or steam the potatoes for 7-10 minutes. If parboiling add salt."
- "When all your fish, eggs and potatoes are cooking make a simple sauce. Melt the butter in a pan and add the milk. Stir the sauce flour with a small amount of water to make a paste and then add to the mix. Stir the mixture until it is thick and smooth. You could add grated cheese here if you want - but this will make the sauce very rich."
- "Break the fish into large chunks and spread into a bowl."
- "Add the eggs if you like. We use eggs in our family! You could vary the ingredients to your taste - cooked prawns or even vegetables such as peas or leeks can be really great."
- "Pour the sauce on top and then cover with plenty of fresh ground black pepper."
- "Layer the potatoes so the overlap similar to fish scales. Use smaller discs to plug gaps in this topping."
- "Brush with some melted butter and finish off with fresh ground black pepper and salt. This is where you can stop if you have made this pie in advance."
- "Place in the middle shelf of an oven at 180 degrees fan. Cook for 45 minutes and ensure the pie is cooked through and golden on top. Leave to stand for 5 minutes before serving."
- "We served this with brown bread, sautéed kale (7 minutes with butter) and frozen peas (boiled 5 minutes with salt and butter). Any green vegetable is going to taste great!"
