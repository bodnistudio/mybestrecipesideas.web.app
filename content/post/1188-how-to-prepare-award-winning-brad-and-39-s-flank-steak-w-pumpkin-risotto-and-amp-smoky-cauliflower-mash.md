Making risotto requires your full attention. Though the rice can be partially cooked in advance and cooled, the finishing process is so precise that the risotto cannot wait for your guests, but rather your guests have to wait for the risotto. You may not need all the stock, but the texture should be loose and creamy. When the risotto is almost ready, heat the sunflower oil in a small pan and quickly fry the sage leaves until crispy - it only takes a matter of seconds.
