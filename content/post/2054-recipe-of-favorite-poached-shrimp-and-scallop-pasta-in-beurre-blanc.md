##### The ingredients needed to make Poached shrimp and scallop pasta in beurre blanc:

1. Take 4 garlic cloves minced
1. Prepare 2 large shallots minced
1. Make ready 2 cups Sauvignon Blanc
1. Get 1 lb angel hair
1. Get 1 1/2 cups butter
1. Prepare 2 lemons (1 for the sauce and 1 for service)

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Scallops are such an easy and underrated weeknight meal, and I know this from experience: I never seem to think about them as a dinner option, but when I do it&#39;s always a slap-hand-to-forehead kind of moment. Scallops sear in mere seconds, and while whipping up a beurre blanc (a.k.a. white butter sauce) may seem intimidating to the uninitiated, it&#39;s actually one of the easiest and tastiest. Kosher salt and ground white pepper, to taste.

Extra virgin olive oil, for sauteing. It was like it had been grilled as a larger roast, attaining only the slightest browning along the sides of the round steak. It was plated with a smear of lumpily mashed peas, two unpeeled over-roasted carrots, some tiny dribbles of beurre blanc, and what the menu described as half a lobster tail poached in butter. Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary. Once the butter is fully incorporated, season the beurre blanc sauce with white pepper and set aside.
