recipeinstructions:

- "NIGIRI: Wet your hands and do not dry. The rice will stick otherwise. Make a small sausage with your thumbs using the rice, and then lay a piece of shrimp or salmon on top and shape again, pressing into your palm. Wrap a thin piece of nori around the Nigiri and it is ready to serve."
- "MAKI: Prepare the bamboo roller by covering it with a piece of cling film. Add a sheet of nori, making sure the shorter side is facing the shorter end of the roller. Lay a thin layer of rice on 3/4 of the nori, and then add the peppers, cucumber and salmon on the end with the rice. Roll the Maki carefully, making sure to tuck in the nori as you roll so it stays tight. Roll it up tight and put in the fridge for fifteen minutes. Repeat for the tuna maki, using tuna, pepper, cucumber and avocado."
- "Using a very sharp knife, slice the maki to make small but thick makis. Use any leftover fish to serve as sashimi."
- "Serve with soya sauce, wasabi and pickled ginger. I also had haddock on the side. Enjoy!"
