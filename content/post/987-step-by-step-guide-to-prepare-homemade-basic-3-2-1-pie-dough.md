<h3>Steps to make Basic 3-2-1 Pie Dough:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Add flour to a large bowl. If using unsalted butter, mix in a few pinches of salt..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cut chilled butter into small cubes and add to flour. Crumble it into the flour with your fingers until the butter turns to pea-sized pieces and dough is sandy..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Mix in the sugar if using. Then gradually mix in the ice water until the dough start to come together..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			On a floured surface knead dough briefly until it forms a smooth ball..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Wrap each ball and refrigerate for at least 1 or 2 hours. You can also make ahead and keep in the fridge up to 1 week before using..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Roll out when ready to get baking! On a well floured surface, unwrap one ball of dough, sprinkle with some flour and start rolling out with your rolling pin..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Divide into two equal pies if you made the full recipe..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Roll out a little, lift and turn it a quarter turn and roll out more. Repeat several times until it&#39;s rolled out into a 30-32 cm (12-13 in) circle..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Trim the rough edges with a knife so it&#39;s a pretty 30 cm/12 in circle (or smaller for smaller pie/tart pan). I used a big bowl as a stencil to cut out..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Here it is after cutting..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Gently lay the trimmed crust into your pie dish and fold over the excess edges. You can make a crimping pattern or use a fork pattern the edges..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			If you don&#39;t need to blind bake, go ahead and add your filling and stick it in the oven!.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			To blind bake for very wet fillings, lay a piece of aluminum foil over the pie crust and fill it with pie weights or dry beans. Bake at 425 F/210 C for 10 minutes or until slightly golden..
