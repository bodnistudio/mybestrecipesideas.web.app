recipeinstructions:
- "Make a pot of tea using the tea bag and water. Leave it to brew for at least 15 minutes - you need it to be undrinkably strong."
- "Place all the ingredients in a large pan and bring to a moderate boil."
- "Simmer gently for about half an hour. Observe the beautiful jewel-like colours developing in your pan."
- "Test the jam using Nigella&#39;s clever saucer method (test a teaspoonful on a cold saucer, place in fridge for 30 seconds, if the jam wrinkles when pushed by a finger the jam is set. If not repeat this process every 5 minutes until the jam wrinkles.)"
- "Remove from the heat, then carefully pour the jam into sterilised jars (4 or so should do it, and I normally run jam jars through the dishwasher before drying them in a low oven - do this while the jam is cooking, removing your jar just before you need it.)"
- "Seal, label and store. If your jam is reasonably well set you can leave it for quite some time - I have a jar a year old that&#39;s still good. Less well set jams should be stored in the fridge and eaten quickly."

1. Prepare  Earl Grey tea bag

With delicious flavor pairings and dazzling aromas, you&#39;ve never had Earl Grey teas like this. I didn&#39;t overdo the tea in the jam: it&#39;s just enough to perk up and wonder what the extra flavor is with the apricots. Place the plums and water into a large pot, and bring to a boil. Stir in the sugar, and add butter to reduce foaming, if needed.

##### Steps to make Plum and Earl Grey jam:

1. Make a pot of tea using the tea bag and water. Leave it to brew for at least 15 minutes - you need it to be undrinkably strong.
1. Place all the ingredients in a large pan and bring to a moderate boil.
1. Simmer gently for about half an hour. Observe the beautiful jewel-like colours developing in your pan.
1. Test the jam using Nigella&#39;s clever saucer method (test a teaspoonful on a cold saucer, place in fridge for 30 seconds, if the jam wrinkles when pushed by a finger the jam is set. If not repeat this process every 5 minutes until the jam wrinkles.)
1. Remove from the heat, then carefully pour the jam into sterilised jars (4 or so should do it, and I normally run jam jars through the dishwasher before drying them in a low oven - do this while the jam is cooking, removing your jar just before you need it.)
1. Seal, label and store. If your jam is reasonably well set you can leave it for quite some time - I have a jar a year old that&#39;s still good. Less well set jams should be stored in the fridge and eaten quickly.


Bring the mixture to a full, rolling boil over high heat, stirring constantly, and then mix in the pectin quickly. In their jam selections they had a blueberry rhubarb one. I&#39;m a big fan of rhubarb paired with strawberries as a compote or in a pie. Peach is such a great flavour on its own and I bet it works so well with the earl grey. I want a piece of toast with your jam! kelley {mountain mama.
