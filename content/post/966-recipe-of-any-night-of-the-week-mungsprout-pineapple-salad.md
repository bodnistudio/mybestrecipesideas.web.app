Unlike other bean sprouts, mung sprouts are eaten cooked in Japan. I created this recipe for my wheat-free diet, but if you like go ahead and use wheat flour for barley flour. It tastes like good old Japan to me!! Chicken and Bean Sprouts seems like an obscure Chinese dish, but this is a great, refreshing, and easy-to-make stir fry. The bean sprouts are crunchy, delicious, and perfect for a light and healthy weekday dinner.
