For me I can&#39;t have tacos without beans and rice. Spanish rice was a staple at our house when growing up but, quite different from what the reall Spanish rice is like - it had ground beef in it and was an entree&#39;. When living in Florida I was introduced to the Puerto Rican version of Spanish rice which is so totally different. In Northern Mexico, Spanish Rice is most often cooked with tomatoes and onions, whereas in Southern Mexico plain white rice is more traditional. With this recipe, you will make rice similar to that served at Tex-Mex and Mexican restaurants in the United States.
