That&#39;s because making oatmeal is more than a two-step process. Regardless, to introduce it into the discussion requires us to flip the script and define what cereal is. Looking for unique recipes using sour cream? You&#39;re cooking your soup with the stock and all the lovely vegetables, and you take about half of the butternut squash out,&#34; Webb explains. &#34;Put it in a blender and then add some of the stock it&#39;s been cooking in and puree it.&#34; Next, take the thick puree and add it back into the soup as it cooks. &#34;It thickens it without having to add any cream.

A creamy pumpkin soup for autumn. This soup is smooth and flavorful, and the addition of ginger lends a sweet and spicy flavor to a traditional seasonal dish. The cinnamon croutons are lovely and make the soup reminiscent of pumpkin pie. The hearty soup—chock-full of leftover ham, veggies and cheese—is creamy and comforting.
