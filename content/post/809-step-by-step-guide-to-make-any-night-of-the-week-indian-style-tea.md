Chai (Spiced Indian-style Tea) From Badmaash restaurant, in Los Angeles, this aromatic tea, called &#34;cutting chai&#34; in India, is served in small glasses because it&#39;s so strong (&#34;cutting&#34; is the transliteration of the Hindi word for &#34;half&#34;). Indians like their Tea with milk - and that does not mean just adding a spot of milk to the tea after infusion.
