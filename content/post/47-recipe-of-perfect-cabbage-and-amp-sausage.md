- "1 tsp Tonys Spice and Herbs"
- "1 tbs Goya  Sazonador Total"

recipeinstructions:
- "Chop bacon in about 1½ inch pieces. I cut straight through the package which makes it easier to handle. Cook bacon in Texas Skillet. (Or large pot) Remove bacon and set aside. Drain off bacon Grease from the skillet and save, leaving a little in the skillet."
- "Chop sausage and add to skillet. Brown completely using med-high heat."
- "Dice onion and bell pepper. On medium heat - When sausage is done add onion and bell pepper to the skillet, add a little additional bacon Grease if necessary. Toss in garlic at the end once onions and peppers are done, careful not to burn garlic."
- "Add rotel, bullion cubes, water and Seasonings to the skillet. Crumble bacon and add to skillet. DO NOT ADD SALT YET. Wash and Chop cabbage into 1 inch pieces. Add to the skillet. I sometimes add a little more bacon Grease optional. You may need to let it wilt a bit before adding remaining cabbage. Mix to coat cabbage with the liquid in the skillet. Add salt to the cabbage if necessary to help draw out the moisture. Careful not to over salt. The other seasonings and bullion are already salty."
- "Once all of your cabbage is in the skillet lower heat to low or med-low cover and simmer until your cabbage is of desired tenderness. I like mine wilted but still a little firm - about 20 Mins."
