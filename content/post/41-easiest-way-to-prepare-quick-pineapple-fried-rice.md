Pineapple fried rice is different from other fried rice because it is the only fried rice cooked with fruits and curry powder. The addition of raisin and cashew nuts convince me that it will taste completely different from the yang chow fried rice that I have posted earlier. Pineapple Fried Rice is a signature Thai dish, so fish sauce is a must to bring together all the flavors, adding that salty edge to balance out the pineapple, as well as umami flavor. Whatever you do, though, don&#39;t ever put your nose to a bottle of fish sauceâ€”just trust that it will do wonders when it&#39;s been added to your cooking!
