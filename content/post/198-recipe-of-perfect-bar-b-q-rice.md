An Authentic Tasting Pork Fried Rice Recipe As you can see by a lot of our recipes, we do like fried rice around here. It&#39;s one of those dinners that everyone loves (thank god there&#39;s some) and you can pretty much whip together using whatever. Rice: While pork is standing, heat oil in wok or large skillet on high heat until oil almost begins to smoke. Add ginger, as well as all vegetables except garlic. When the rice&#39;s became soft and water became dry then keep the fire low. 

So that is going to wrap it up with this special food bar b q rice recipe. Thank you very much for your time. I'm confident you can make this at home.
