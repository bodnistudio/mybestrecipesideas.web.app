<h3>Steps to make Southwestern Meat Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Preheat oven to 350Â°F..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Prepare a 9&#34; spring form pan by lining bottom with parchment paper. I do this for a nicer presentation and easy slide out of finished product but you may use a pie plate or baking dish..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Mix all meat pie ingredients in large bowl and place in your choice of cooking dish.  Build a well into meat.Pat meat filling flat in middle and push slightly up sides of baking dish..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake 40 minutes. I suggest placing a spring form pan on a baking tray to catch any juices flowing from meat cooking..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Mix the corn muffin mix according to package directions just before ready to place on top of meat as it will become dry being prepared too early.  Add the extra ingredients I&#39;ve included. Batter will be thick..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			After the meat cooks for 40 minutes remove from oven and top with muffin mix..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cook an additional 15 -20 minutes or until muffin top is set..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Serve with extra salsa, sour cream our guacamole on top each portion if you like..
