You&#39;ll want to make sure to whisk up the chia pudding really well before letting it sit to gel. If the chia pudding mixture becomes too thick if you let it sit overnight, simply add a bit more almond milk. But then I realized that not everyone likes pandanus scent. Therefore, I created a recipe with another material that is matcha latte. In a small bowl, add matcha powder.
