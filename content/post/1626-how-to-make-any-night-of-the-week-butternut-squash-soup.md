- "Cut celery and carrot. Again size doesn&#39;t matter."
- "Add salt and pepper and the bundle of tied up thyme."
- "Chop rosemary. Again size doesn&#39;t matter. But the smaller the better. And add to pot"

- "BE CAREFUL WHEN BLENDING!!! Blending hot ingredients may cause the soup to splatter out of the blender!!! Blend on slowest speed first then increase.   Blend all the ingredients. Depending on how thick you like it you might need to add more water. Same goes for salt and pepper. Try the soup before serving. It doesn&#39;t need any cream to make it creamy. It&#39;s hearty and creamy without any dairy."
- "On a last note I don&#39;t like to waste anything. Meaning those seeds that came from the squash are quite yummy. You can use them in the soup. Roast them at 300°F until they get a little color or you can start to smell them while roasting."
