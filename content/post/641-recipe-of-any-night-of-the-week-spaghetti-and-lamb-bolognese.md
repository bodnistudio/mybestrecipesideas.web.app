Traditionally, bolognese uses a mixture of ground beef and veal to create a rich, meaty sauce that&#39;s perfect for spooning over thick noodles like pappardelle. Using ground lamb adds a complexity and distinctness to the classic sauce. This recipe also differs in that it incorporates some slightly nontraditional flavor elements that pair well with lamb, like cinnamon and coriander. We&#39;ve written several recipes for bolognese sauce over the years here at Serious Eats, and these recipes usually fall in two camps: the traditional slow-cooked multiple-meat bolognese camp or the easier, lighter, faster meat-sauce-maybe-known-as-bolognese camp. This lamb bolognese from Michael Romano and Karen Stabiner&#39;s Family Table falls squarely in the middle.
