The Deluxe Veggie Pizza is a food item; a Veggie Pizza upgraded with many more toppings. Made with a crescent roll crust and flavored with ranch dressing mix, Veggie Pizza is a staple party appetizer in the Midwest! Deluxe Crustless pizza with pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions, baked with our original sauce and signature three cheeses, topped with romesan seasoning. My favorite is the veggie deluxe (fresh spinach, mushrooms, onions, artichoke hearts, baked eggplant, Roma tomatoes, black olives, fresh garlic &amp; extra mozzarella)-they don&#39;t skimp on the toppings, the baked eggplant really sets this pizza apart from other veggie pizzas!!
