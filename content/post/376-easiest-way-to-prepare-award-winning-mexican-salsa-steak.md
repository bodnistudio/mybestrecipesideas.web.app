The corn salsa can be used with many other proteins, and would be great. Served w/ potato &amp; house salad or rice, beans, pico de gallo, quacamole &amp; sour. Steaks in Green Sauce (Salsa Verde) with Squash. Having grown up in a household where almost every guisado (everyday stews) had lots of vegetables in it, it&#39;s common for me to always add some sort of veggies to my dishes when cooking at home.
