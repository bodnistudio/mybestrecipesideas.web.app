You combine all the sauce and spices and pour it into a baking dish. Top it off with cheese and your favorite toppings (we did regular and mini pepperonis), and then you bake it. I hadn&#39;t made pizza dip before but I decided it would be a kid-friendly appetizer to take to the New Year&#39;s Eve party we attended. When researching recipes to try, I discovered feedback about the cheese not staying hot and melted if the dip sits out for too long. And since our dip was going to be sitting out for several hours I knew I needed to make this dip in my slow cooker.
