- "Combine flour with baking powder and salt in medium bowl, whisk to combine."
- "Add flour mixture to butter / sugar mixture and mix just until blended. Fold in chocolate chips."
- "Divide dough into 10 balls. Place on parchment lined platter and refrigerate until very cold, at least 2 to 3 hours."
- "Have ready regular standard cupcake tins. Turn cupcake tins upside down. Cover every other cupcake tin bottom with foil  liners, or cut foil to fit over bottom smoothly. Spray foil liners with non stick spray."
