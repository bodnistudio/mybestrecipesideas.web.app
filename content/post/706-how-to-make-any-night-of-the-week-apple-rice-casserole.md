In large non-stick skillet cook crumbled breakfast sausage over medium-high heat. Sprinkle each layer of apples with cinnamon and sugar, using only half the sugar. Apple, raisins and spices give this tasty sausage-rice casserole a taste of autumn. We enjoy it with a green salad on a cold fall day. It would be a nice potluck dish, tooâ€”just double the recipe if needed.
