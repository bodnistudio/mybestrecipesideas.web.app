- "2 (14.5 oz) cans whole tomatoes  drained"
- "6 cups tomato juice"

- "1 tsp chopped fresh parsley"
- "3-4 seasoned croutons"
- "2 tsp shredded mozzarella or parmesan"
- " couple dashes Tabasco sauce"
- " drizzle of extra virgin olive oil"
- "pinch cayenne powder or smoked paprika"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt butter with olive oil in a 3 to 4 quart stock pot over medium heat. Add onions and garlic. Sautee until onions are translucent. About 5 - 7 minutes."
- "Transfer onion and garlic to blender. Add drained cans of whole tomatoes. Cover and pulse until you have a coarse puree. Note: You may want to vent the lid slightly so steam doesn&#39;t pop the lid off."
- "Transfer puree back to stockpot over medium high heat. Add tomato juice, soup base and 3 tbs of the sugar. Taste and add up to 1 more tbs sugar at this time. Note: The sugar is used to help cut the acidity of the tomatoes. The acidity of tomatoes can vary from batch to batch so always start low when adding the sugar."
- "Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium and simmer uncovered for 20 - 25 minutes to reduce slightly (about the consistency of a thin gravy). Taste soup after it has reduced. Add pepper, salt to taste, and up to 2 tbs more sugar as needed/desired (I normally use the full 6 tbs)."
- "Reduce heat to low. Once soup has stopped bubbling stir in evaporated milk until well incorporated. Then stir in chopped basil. Cover and let sit about 5 minutes for flavors to blend."
- "Dish up and garnish with any combination of suggested garnishes above."
- "Alternate version: For a smoother consistency, before adding evaporated milk carefully run soup through a fine mesh sieve to remove all the solids. Return to pot, then add evaporated milk and basil as in step 5."
