		In our family she gave her recipe for dressing--yep y&#39;all in the South we don&#39;t call it stuffing--and her pecan pie only to me.

		First, whip up the pie crust: Mix the flour and salt in a bowl.
	
		Add the vegetable shortening and salted butter.
	
		Work the butter into the flour using a dough cutter until the mixture resembles tiny.
