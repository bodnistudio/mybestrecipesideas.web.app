The directions seem long and scary, but these cookies are actually very easy to make. I hope you enjoy them as much as my family and friends do.

Layer them in glasses, waiting for each one to set. I did use powdered gelatin, but you can also use gelatin sheets. I&#39;ll share another panna cotta recipe, using gelatin sheets in the future. With the weather warming up, it is time for lighter desserts like this Tri-Layer Chocolate Panna Cotta. Angel food cake, fresh berries, and whipped topping, layered in a trifle bowl, makes for a pretty presentation; then you can see the layers of the dessert.
