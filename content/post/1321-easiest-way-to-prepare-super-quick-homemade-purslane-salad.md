Sweet Potato Salad. by Kendall Smith. This Sweet Potato Salad with avocado, tomato, onion, lime and cilantro is SO easy to make and is guaranteed to be a huge hit in any group! The best treat of all, though, was what grew in cracks around the driveway and near the street: a weed called purslane, or what we knew as perper (pronounced PER-per, rolling the &#34;Rs&#34;). My mom would add tomatoes, red onions, and vinegar, transforming the peppery weed into a flavorful salad. Remove the leaves and leaf tips from the purslane stems and add to a salad bowl, discard stems.
