recipeinstructions:
- "Roll flat the rice crispy bar"
- "Place the fruit roll up flat. This will be like the Nori in a sushi roll. Any type will do, we used a rainbow colored for visual effect"
- "The flattened rice crispy bar goes on top of the roll up. Trim the excess roll up."
- "The licorice middle is next. I like the pull n peel because it&#39;s easier to customize the size. I&#39;ve found peeling a little less then half works best. Cut the length to fit the roll. Add the Swedish fish or any other gummy smile you like."
- "Roll it all up tight. The rice crispy bar makes it all stick well."
- "Slice into segments. I find 8 peaces per roll is about right. Small enough that it fits in your mouth."
