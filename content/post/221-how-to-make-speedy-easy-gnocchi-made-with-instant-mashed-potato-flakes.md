- "150 ml Boiling water"
- "80 grams Plain flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the mashed potato powder into a bowl, and mix in the boiling water. If you use the kind I usually get (from Costo), it should already be seasoned, so you won&#39;t need to add any seasonings."
- "Add the flour, and mix well."

- "Serve on a plate, and done."
- "I mixed them with tuna tomato sauce this time."
- "It&#39;s also delicious to add wiener sausages and broccoli, and serve with cream sauce."
