<h3>Instructions to make Mixed Berry Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Pour berries into a large pot. Pour in water and sugar. Bring to a boil, reduce heat. Let simmer about 20 minutes. Mash berries with potato masher. Simmer a bit longer and repeat. I wanted some texture, but you can mash until your hearts content..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			When berries have reached your desired consistency, add in lemon soda. (You can substitute with another citrus soda containing real juice)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Reduce by about half. Mix corn starch with a little bit of water to make a thickening agent. Add to berries..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			After berry mix has thickened, take off heat until cooled to room temperature. Take your pie crusts and let them sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Unroll one on your pie pan. Add berries in..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Now... you could just plop the top on, make an x in the middle and call it a day... but I opted to try to make it pretty. Using a pizza cutter, I sliced the dough and arranged it as so. Brush on egg, sprinkle top with sugar, trim excess dough and cover sides with foil to prevent burning..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Preheat oven to 375 F. Place pie on cookie sheet, bake for 40 minutes. Remove foil. Back an additional 15-20 minutes. If your pie is beginning to bubble and brown nicely before then, remove foil at that time and bake a bit more. Once pie is bubbling and browned, itâ€™s done. Allow to cool completely so the pie can set up. Slice and serve..
