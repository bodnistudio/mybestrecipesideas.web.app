It is alright of the dough looks a little crumbly at first but should come together after once folded into self a few times and rolled out with a rolling pin..

			Once you have rolled dough out with pen place into pie pan. It&#39;s ok if the dough crumbles a little. Use a knife to cut around the edges of the pan to make it look more uniform. Then krimmp the pie crust or use pinching method around the edges. Use a fork to pierce the pie crust in the bottom part of the pan to ensure a through cooking..

			Fill crust with pie filling of choice, freeze for later, or pre-cook at 450*F for 10-15min (or until golden brown)..
