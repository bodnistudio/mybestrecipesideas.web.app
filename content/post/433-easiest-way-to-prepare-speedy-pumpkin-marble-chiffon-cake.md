		Chocolate Marble Chiffon Cake is a combination of vanilla and chocolate baked together.
	
		This marble chiffon cake is moist and delicious.
	
		Pumpkin normally appears in rich pies or hearty cakes.
	
		But here, with rice flour and a hint of spice, it produces a moist, fluffy cake with subtle flavors.
	
		I&#39;ve tasted it with every imaginable topping from frosting to whipped cream and candied nuts, only to find that a sprinkling of spiced sugar is the best.
