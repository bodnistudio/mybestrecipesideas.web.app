It&#39;s a treat the Urban Farmer has been dreaming about recently. It puts her in mind of the treat featured in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn: white bread doused with milk, then fancified with a sprinkling of sugar. Choco-coffee bread pudding is way worthier and fancier and tons of upgrades higher than the dessert featured. Right, the Coffee Porter Chocolate Bread Pudding recipe by Linda Schneider on Taste (tastecooking.com).

The problem was, just around the time I. Place in a buttered casserole dish. Now, I&#39;m not denying the deliciousness of bread pudding for breakfast.
