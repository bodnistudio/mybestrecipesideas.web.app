These Mocha Cupcakes (Coffee Cupcakes) and this Mocha Cake Roll are two of my favorite coffee- based desserts and I think today&#39;s recipe is even better than those! The coffee flavor in this chocolate chip coffee cake comes from. Dense, fudgy coffee chocolate cake with rich, dark chocolate and coffee frosting topped with a mountain of chocolate malt balls. You might be all chocolated (yep, that&#39;s a word now) out now but I&#39;m taking my chances because this cake, this glorious, four-tiered cake sandwiched with fudgy, coffee-flavoured chocolate frosting, is the most chocolatiest of chocolatey cakes. Using electric mixer, beat butter in large bowl until smooth.
