recipeingredient:
- "500 gms Pabda fish"
- "35 gms Yellow and black mustard mixed"
- " Taro Kochu Alvi leaves enough to wrap the fishes"
- " Salt as per taste"
- "2 tbsps  2 tbsps  23tbsps more Mustard oil"
- "1 tbsp Aam Kasundi Bengali mango mustard sauceoptional"
- "1 tsp Turmeric"
- "25 gms gross weight Ginger make it into paste"
- "2 tbsps Curd"
- " Green  red raw Chillies as preferred by you 45 or more"
- " Little Water to grind the mustard seeds"
- " Water to steam in a steamer I use MOMO steamer"
recipeinstructions:
- "Clean and Wash the fish and sprinkle and apply Turmeric and salt and keep it aside. As the fishes were quite long I cut two fishes into half from the middle."
- "Make a paste out of the ginger. In a mixer grinder jar add the mustard seeds with little salt, little water enough to help in grinding the mustard seeds, grind with small pulse / intervals (do not grind at one go otherwise it will be bitter), add few raw green chillies as per your taste, the ginger paste, curd, Turmeric, 2 tbsps of mustard oil and give it a quick mix in the jar to form a homogeneous smooth masala paste."
- "Pour the masala paste (mustard mix) in a steel bowl or plate and add 2 tbsps more of mustard oil and give a quick mix with your fingers, then take one fish piece at a time and apply the mustard paste on it and place it on the taro leaves (here I used two leaves as the leaves were small overlapping each other with pointed ends outwards)with generous amount of the paste and add one chilli and little more mustard oil on top."
- "Now fold the leaves nicely and tie it with a clean string so that it doesn&#39;t open or have openings (make sure the leaves doesn&#39;t tear). If you don&#39;t have enough leaves, simply put the fish and the paste in a steel dabba (Tiffin box with tight lid) or wrap the plate tightly with aluminium foil (I have used three aluminium foils covered from top then from and again from bottom and finally from the top so that extra moisture doesn&#39;t enter.... otherwise your mustard paste will become watery)."
- "Now place this in a steamer and keep it on top of steaming boiling hot water and steam for 20 minutes with full flame on high and then put off the flame let it rest for 10 minutes in the steamer. Serve it hot with steaming hot rice along with more chillies and mustard oil (if you prefer). Bon Appetit!!!"
