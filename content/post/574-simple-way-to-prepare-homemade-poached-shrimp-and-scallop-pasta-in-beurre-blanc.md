It was like it had been grilled as a larger roast, attaining only the slightest browning along the sides of the round steak. It was plated with a smear of lumpily mashed peas, two unpeeled over-roasted carrots, some tiny dribbles of beurre blanc, and what the menu described as half a lobster tail poached in butter. Scallops are such an easy and underrated weeknight meal, and I know this from experience: I never seem to think about them as a dinner option, but when I do it&#39;s always a slap-hand-to-forehead kind of moment. Remove tough muscle from side of each scallop if necessary.
