<h3>Steps to make Mulberry pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Mix the salt into the flour and drizzle the honey on top of it.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Drop the cubes of butter into the mixture and cut it into the flour using a pastry blender or pair of forks..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Once you achieve a coarse meal consistency (it&#39;s okay, in fact good if there are large pieces of butter still visible)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Drizzle the ice cold water into the mix and press it together (not knead) to make a dough..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Divide this into two, roll into balls, flatted into discs, wrap up in clingwrap and chill overnight..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			The next day, roll one of the two dough ball (or disc) into a disc and line an 8&#34; pie tin with it. Fork the dough to make holes in it all over (not too many that the filling might leak)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Roll out the other dough ball and cut it into half inch strips..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a mixing bowl, mix all the filling ingredients (scrape out the vanilla bean with a knife and throw the pods away, use only the insides)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pour this into the pie tin lined with pastry dough and smoothen flat..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Use every alternate strip from the previously cut dough and line up one direction of the lattice layer..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Weave the remaining strips at right angles to the previous ones (YouTube this)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pinch and crimp the edges of the dough..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Brush the top of the dough with one beaten egg for a nice golden gloss. Drizzle sugar on it if desired..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Line the edges with a strip of foil (because the edges tend to cook faster and burn and place in the freezer for 30 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Preheat an oven to 200°C for 15 minutes while the pie chills..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake the pie for 15 minutes and then lower the temperature to 175°C and cook for an additional 30 minutes, or till the top of the pie is beautifully browned..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Once ready, cool for a half hour or more before slicing up and serving (with vanilla ice cream, if you&#39;re feeling fancy).
			
			
		</li>
