recipeingredient:
- " Sweet potatoes"
- " Sugar"
- " Margarine"
- " Honey"
- " Fresh cream or milk"
- " Egg yolks"
- " Mirin"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel and cut the potatoes into chunks of a uniform size and soak in water to remove any bitterness."
- "Put in a ziplock bag or any other kind of microwaveable bag and put the potatoes in the microwave. Leave the bag unsealed and warm the potatoes – they should soften in about 4- 5 minutes."
- "Squeeze out any excess air and seal the bag. Crush the potatoes with a rolling pin whilst they are still warm."
- "When the potatoes are cool to the touch, add the sugar and margarine into the bag, close it up and rub the margarine into the sugar."
- "To finish crushing the potatoes, either roll over the bag with a rolling pin or mash with your fingers. Mash to whatever consistency you want."
- "Add the egg yolk. I wanted to save some for glazing, so I beat it first in a separate container. If you don&#39;t want a glaze, just add it straight to the bag."
- "If you are going to glaze your snacks, save about 2 - 3 teaspoons of egg yolk and mix with a little mirin."
- "Once the egg yolk has mixed in with the other ingredients in the bag, add the cream and mix well again."
- "To avoid dirtied hands, fill the cups by snipping off a corner of the vinyl bag and piping the mixture in."
- "Here, after piping in the mixture I flattened half of the snacks down with a knife and made half into ball shapes."
- "Coat with the glaze if you are using one and bake in an oven preheated to 180°C for 20 minujtes to finish."
