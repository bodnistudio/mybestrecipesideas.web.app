Pasta Salad should be stored in an airtight container in the fridge. Canned tuna, dry pasta, and navy beans unite with shelf-stable powerhouses like artichoke hearts, Castelvetrano olives, and honey to form this French-inspired salad. You only need a little bit of produce to make this dish feel fresh, and like other oil-based pasta salads, it gets more flavorful the longer it sits. Not only is this pasta salad filled to the brim with mouthwatering grilled vegetables, but a homemade balsamic vinaigrette adds delicious flavor to the dish. Pasta Salad Pointer: To keep your salad moist, toss the cooked pasta in lemon juice and olive oil, then refrigerate overnight.
