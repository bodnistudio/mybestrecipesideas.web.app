recipeinstructions:
- "Soak glutinous rice in cold water for a few hours"
- "Cook both jasmine and glutinous rice (in a rice cooker or however you&#39;d like)"
- "Peel and cut mango into 1cm by 1cm strips. Also cut into thin slices for topping."
- "In a microwaveable bowl, combine brown sugar and coconut, microwave for 30s so the brown sugar is partially melted"
- "In a food processor, pulverize oreos into a powder. Use a bag and fists if you must"
- "When the rice is ready, mix in a few tablespoons a condensed milk until the desired texture is acheived. We don’t want a pudding texture, nor do we want individual grains."
- "When the rice is properly combined, lay out a piece of plastic wrap on your sushi mat. Spread out the rice into a square, keeping the thickness to 0.5-1cm."
- "Try to fill the square as much as possible, while allowing overflow space. Sprinkle the oreo crumbs on top until it’s evenly covered. Now take your mango strips and coconut mixture, and place in a line 2 inches near the edge of one side. The photo here replaces cranberry sauce but tbh coconut is better"
- "Roll up one side while holding onto your fillings to avoid it from slipping. Tuck it around your filling, while pulling out the plastic wrap so it doesn’t get rolled in. Continue rolling, while evenly applying pressure to the roll. Once you get to the other side, give it a full roll to regain the circular shape."
- "Slice (dip knife in water in between), and top with mango slices and a sprinkling of cocoa powder."
