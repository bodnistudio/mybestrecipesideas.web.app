Corned Beef Egg Sandwich 蛋牛治 the way that I like it: soft bread enveloping tender flavorful beef and just scrambled lusciously soft and buttery eggs. This sandwich uses corned beef, which is sold in cans. Corned beef is beef that is brined and then cooked until tender and full of flavor. I had leftover corned beef, as we all do right now, so I decided to sort of combine the two breakfasts, but in sandwich form, and without the fussy hollandaise sauce.
