After, cook the beef sausage your favourite way to do so, I grilled mine. To finish prep, microwave the hot dog bun for about 15 - 20 seconds. Split the bun in the middle but not all the way through and spread the butter evenly over the inside of the bun."
- "To assemble, place the lettuce in the middle of the bun followed by the beef sausage and next just fill up any spaces with fries and cucumber cut into sticks. To finish, drizzle over some tomato ketchup and salad cream or mayonnaise. Enjoy!"
