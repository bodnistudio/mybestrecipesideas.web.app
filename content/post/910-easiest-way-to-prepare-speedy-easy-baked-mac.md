Baked mac is something I make at home once or twice a week. I toss pasta and meat sauce together, top the mixture with grated cheese, throw it all in the oven for a few minutes and call it a day. However, to turn this dinner staple into a party-worthy dish, a simple mornay sauce sure does make a whole lot of difference. Give up the box mix because making Classic Baked Macaroni and Cheese from scratch is easier than you think. Shredding a block of cheese adds a little more prep time but the smooth and creamy results are worth it.
