This quick pasta bake is comfort in a skillet. You&#39;ll toss rigatoni tubes with sausage, charred Brussels sprouts, and a Worcestershire-spiked cheese sauce to achieve a wonderfully creamy pasta dinner. Rigatoni is the perfect pick for this dish, as the shape encourages all the mix-ins to nestle inside the wide tubes. Chicken and penne pasta simmer together in a garlicky, creamy broth, and are quickly baked between cheesy layers of Parmesan and mozzarella.

Top with fresh parsley as desired. This pasta is a little bit Italian, a little bit Mexican and a whole lot delicious. Cheese, meat, veggies, and spices come together in an easy, enjoyable and fuss-free dinner. I made this baked pasta with cellentani noodles this time but you could easily substitute whatever variety of pasta you have on hand like penne or bow tie noodles. The key to pulling off Giada&#39;s decadent baked pasta dish is all in the bechamel sauce — a creamy mixture of butter, flour and whole milk that makes the perfect rich coating for the rigatoni and.
