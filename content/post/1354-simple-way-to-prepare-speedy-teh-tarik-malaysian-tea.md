Teh tarik, or &#39;pulled tea&#39;, is more than a beverage. An iconic Malaysian drink, the process of making the tea is a form of art. At mamak stalls where teh tarik is usually found, the tea-maker would skillfully pour and pull a long stream of freshly brewed tea from one huge steel mug to another, occasionally doing some stunts. I am in love with Hong Kong style milk tea (see recipe here), and on a trip to Malaysia, I discovered that I love Malaysian pulled tea, teh tarik, just as much. The delicious teh tarik, which means &#34;pull&#34; tea, is made using sweetened creamer.
