So, I normally buy frozen abalone in shells, which are usually from Chile. Live fresh abalone when cooked for just a few minutes can result in very tender texture as well. But I don&#39;t think frozen abalone can be cooked this way successfully. To prepare the abalone for cooking, all I do is slide a short-bladed knife around the edge between the shell and the flesh to remove the meat. I cut off the intestine and small piece of gristle at the head end and set them aside, as I do use them.
