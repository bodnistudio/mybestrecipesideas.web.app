recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 425°. Wash potatoes and poke holes with toothpick, knife, or fork. Coat thoroughly with oil and season the outsides to taste with seasoning salt or desired spices. Bake in the oven for 45 mins. Or until tender. (I also added grated parmesan this time.)"

- "Add spices to desired taste and chopped green onion. Here is where I also sometimes add in 1/3 cup of the crumbled bacon as well."
- "Beat with mixer on high until desired texture is achieved. Sometimes I like to leave it a little chunky other times I make it more smooth amd creamy. Depends on my mood and company."
- "Using a spoon, scoop mixture into potato boat halves. (About a half cup in each.) Line up side by side to support each other."
- "Top with remaining bacon crumbles, shredded cheese, and if desired chopped green onion. Bake in oven at 375° for 30-40 mins or until cheese begins to brown around the edges. Enjoy!"
