Hey everyone, it is Louise, welcome to our recipe site. Today, we're going to make a special dish, baking fish pie. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

It was also thick enough to bind the fish nicely together, making a definite bottom layer to the pie. Baking the potatoes instead of boiling them before mashing them was a new technique for me but one I will now use frequently (I did bake mine in the microwave which saved a lot of time). The result a tasty browned topping on a succulent fish base.

I saw a similar pie on a jamie Oliver program, and decided to give it a try when I was given a fish last night. I oven baked our fish in foil, saving the juices, and replacing a little of the wine with them. Combining fish, leeks, milk, butter, and potatoes, a fish pie is a one-pot supper dish. Some like to sprinkle a fish pie with grated cheese but that&#39;s optional, as is the addition of hard-cooked eggs seen in some recipes. Serve fish pie with peas or other fresh greens.
