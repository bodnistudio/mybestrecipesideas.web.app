So far we have whipped Dalgona Coffee, keto dalgona coffee, whipped hot chocolate, Whipped Mocha dalgona coffee, whipped strawberry milk and now we have whipped Green tea! You can also call this drink Dalgona Matcha, or whipped matcha whatever you want to call it is fine by me. Matcha is a green tea powder, and dalgona matcha is simply a whipped iced matcha latte!
