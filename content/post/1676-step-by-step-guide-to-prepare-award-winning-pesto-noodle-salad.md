Zesty pesto, mellowed and thickened with a little mayonnaise, makes a lovely sauce. I go all-out green by adding sweet peas to both the pesto sauce and the pasta. Toasted pine nuts add flavor and crunch. And, finally, mozzarella pearls and fresh basil jazz the whole dish up. Pasta salads are the ultimate summer move, especially when it&#39;s too hot to use the oven.
