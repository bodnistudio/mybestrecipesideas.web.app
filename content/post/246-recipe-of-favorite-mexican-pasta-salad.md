Here&#39;s a printable copy of our Easy Mexican Pasta Salad. A few notes/tips for this Mexican Pasta Salad: Pasta: use whatever shape pasta you like best! I&#39;d recommend pasta that is a little smaller and the more texture, the better! The more texture on the pasta, the more it can absorb the dressing and ensure that it gets spread to every section of the pasta. Place the macaroni, corn, beans, olives, tomatoes, green onions, red onion, and cilantro (if using) in a large bowl.
