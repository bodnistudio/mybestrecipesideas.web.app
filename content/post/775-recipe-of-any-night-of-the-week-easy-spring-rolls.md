You can really taste the filling. Recipes for spring rolls vary according to the chef - and different fillings and cooking treatments distinguish the various versions. Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese cultures have adopted certain varieties, while in the United States, the spring roll sometimes looks more like the thicker wrapped, denser Chinese egg roll. I like to serve them with homemade peanut sauce for dipping and they make a great light lunch, dinner or appetizer. Fill a large bowl with warm water.
