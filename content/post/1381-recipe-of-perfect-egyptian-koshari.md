Now add the garlic, coriander, and red pepper flakes, if using, and saute briefly until fragrant (30-45 seconds more). Stir in tomato sauce and pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens (15 minutes or so). Stir in the distilled white vinegar, and turn the heat to low. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve."

Reduce the heat to low and cook until lentils are just tender (15-17 minutes). Drain from water and season with a little salt. (Note: when the lentils are ready, they should not be fully cooked. They should be only par-cooked and still have a bite to them as they need to finish cooking with the rice"
- "Now, for the rice. Drain the rice from its soaking water. Combine the par-cooked lentils and the rice in the saucepan over medium-high heat with 1 tbsp cooking oil, salt, pepper, and coriander. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly."

Now cover and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed and both the rice and lentils are well cooked through (about 20 minutes). Keep covered and undisturbed for 5 minutes or so."
- "Now make the pasta. While the rice and lentils are cooking, make the pasta according to package instructions by adding the elbow pasta to boiling water with a dash of salt and a little oil. Cook until the pasta is al dente. Drain."
- "Cover the chickpeas and warm in the microwave briefly before serving."
- "For the vinegar sauce. Mix the half cup vinegar, 1/4 cup of water, cumin, garlic, chili powder, paprika. Mix it all together well"
- "Put it All Together!  To serve, fluff the rice and lentils with a fork and transfer to a serving platter. Top with the elbow pasta and 1/2 of the tomato sauce, then the chickpeas, and finally 1/2 of the crispy onions for garnish. Serve, passing the remaining sauce, crispy onions and vinegar sauce separately. Enjoy"
