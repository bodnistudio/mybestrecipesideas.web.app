I just had to inject more vegetables into this casserole to feel right, so I added an onion, fresh mushrooms, and a can of diced tomatoes (not fresh, but better than nothing). This barley and mushroom casserole is a tasty side dish, and it goes particularly well with grilled steaks or roast beef. Use plain button mushrooms, portobello, or a wild mushroom assortment. In a medium bowl, combine flour, salt and pepper.
