##### The ingredients needed to make Egg Fried Rice:

1. Get  cooked cooled down white rice (I used one of those single serving instant rice cups)
1. Take  eggs
1. Get  chopped green onions (yknow the real skinny ones? If that‚Äôs too much onion for you, use less)
1. Take  minced garlic (if too much, use less)
1. Take  salt
1. Take  sprinkle of black pepper to taste

Deceptively simple, but a huge favorite and crowd-pleaser. My egg fried rice recipe uses egg that&#39;s slightly flavored with turmeric and paprika, which I think is a unique addition. It adds color to the dish, making it a vibrant yellow. A great way to use up leftover rice, this quick fried rice cooks up with frozen peas, baby carrots, eggs, and soy and sesame sauces.
