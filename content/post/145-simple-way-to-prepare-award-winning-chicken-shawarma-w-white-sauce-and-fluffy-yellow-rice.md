There is a Middle Eastern restaurant close to my work that makes the absolute best chicken shawarma plate. The thin slices of chicken are wonderfully seasoned and they pair it with a buttery turmeric rice that is spot-on. It is a combination of thick, Greek-style yogurt, lemon juice, finely minced or grated garlic, dill, and salt. This turmeric yellow rice is full of aromatic flavors and makes an elegant side dish!
