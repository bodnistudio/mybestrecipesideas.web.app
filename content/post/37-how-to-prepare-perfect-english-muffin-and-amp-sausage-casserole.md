English muffin &amp; sausage casserole is something which I've loved my entire life. They're fine and they look fantastic.

English muffins are very different -- they are a bit chewey, and they have a coarser crumb with lots of big holes that leave all the bumps and ridges that make them very crispy when toasted. To acheive this, the dough is usually very soft like a batter, and it contains both yeast and -- added near the end of the raising -- some baking soda. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, add flour, sugar, and salt.

English Muffins are all about the big pockets of air, that create the &#34;nooks and crannies&#34; inside the bread. If you&#39;re like me you love loading yours up with butter, as it just seeps right into those nooks, making for the most comforting breakfast. In this recipe what creates these pockets of air are the bubbles formed during fermentation. Split the English muffins with a fork, spread with butter or jam (or both!), and eat.
