- "Put the cooked ingredients from Step 2 in the casserole or gratin dish."
- "Top with melting cheese and bake in an oven for 5-10 minutes. Done."
- "If you use salted salmon, it will be too salty. If using salted salmon, use less roux and more milk to adjust the taste."
- "If you use stew roux, you can omit the soup cube. If you don&#39;t use it, saute butter and flour together to make a roux and then make bechamel sauce, or just thicken the sauce with katakuriko dissolved in water."
