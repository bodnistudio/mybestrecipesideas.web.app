A rib steak is a beef steak sliced from the rib primal of a beef. Rib-eye steak (which comes from — you guessed it — the rib section, or mid-section, of the cow) is a full-flavored cut of beef with lots of marbling throughout, which keeps it juicy when cooked. It&#39;s often reserved for special occasions, like birthdays and anniversaries. This cut of beef contains several different muscles, the largest of which are the longissimus dorsi (aka eye), a tender muscle also found in the strip steak, and the fattier spinalis dorsi (aka deckle or rib cap), which sits on top of the longissimus dorsi.
