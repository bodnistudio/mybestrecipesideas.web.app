Borrowed from Hungarian paprika, from Serbo-Croatian pàprika, from pȁpar, from Proto-Slavic *pьpьrь, from Latin piper, from Ancient Greek πέπερι (péperi, &#34;pepper&#34;), from Indo-Aryan; compare Sanskrit पिप्पलि (pippali, &#34;long pepper&#34;). Akin to paprikash. (UK) IPA(key): /ˈpæpɹɨkə/, /pəˈpɹiːkə/. Paprika es una marca de productos de diseño detrás de la cual hay un DREAM TEAM que transpira la camiseta para hacer que lleguen al mercado estas cosas lindas. Paprika movie reviews &amp; Metacritic score: Dr. Atsuko Chiba is a genius scientist by day, and a kick-ass dream warrior named Paprika by night.
