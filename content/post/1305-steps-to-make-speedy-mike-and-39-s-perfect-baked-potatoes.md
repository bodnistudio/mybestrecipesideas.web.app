recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven to 400°."
- "Clean and chop vegetables of your choosing. Cover and refrigerate."
- "Fully clean and fully dry your Idaho #1 grade potatoes."
- "With a sharp knife - peirce your spuds three times at both ends and once in the middle. Or, you can use a fork to peirce them."
- "Place your spuds on a large piece of tinfoil. Shiney side up."
- "Smear your potatoes generously with cold bacon grease. Place back on tinfoil. You can use olive oil but, bacon grease definitely makes these better!"
- "Sprinkle fresh cracked black pepper, sea salt, garlic powder and onion powder to taste on both sides of your bacon greased potatoes. I tend to go heavy on the sea salt! These are big spuds!"
- "Wrap your potatoes up tightly."
- "Double wrap your potatoes tightly in another sheet of tinfoil. Again, shiney side up. A double wrap is more steak house style and steams your spuds more evenly."
- "Place potatoes seam side up on the center rack and place a cookie sheet on the rack underneath it to catch any potential drippings."
- "● Bake for 1 1/2 hours. After that, gently peirce potatoes with a sharp knife in the center where you&#39;ll eventually slice your potatoes open. If the knife enters with ease - you&#39;ll know they&#39;re fully baked. If not, bake a bit longer until soft.                                                                                                                                                                                                               ● Know that if you&#39;re baking more than 2 large potatoes - you&#39;ll need to increase your baking time by approximately 15 minutes."
- "● Once fully baked - you&#39;ll have two options. You can either serve by slitting the tinfoil and potato - then squeezing both ends together to force the moist insides up and out. Fluff with fork. Serve immediately with toppers of your guests choosing.                                                                                                              ● Or, you can do the exact same thing but, gently scoop out the insides with a large spoon leaving your shells fully in tact. Place all insides quickly in a bowl, mix in all of your toppers in and, gently place back into your potato shells. You may need to re-heat mixture [not tinfoil] in the microwave before plating. Garnish with fresh chives and parsley. Enjoy!"
