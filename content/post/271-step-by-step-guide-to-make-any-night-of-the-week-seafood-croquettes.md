recipeingredient:
- " Mashed Potatoes Roughly"
- " Smoked Salmon"
- " Scallops"
- " Jumbo Shrimp"
- " Cheddar Cheese"
- " Eggs"
- " Flour"
- " Bread Crumbs"
- " Old Bay Seasoning"
recipeinstructions:
- "Clean shrimp, slice in half lengthwise then chop into thirds. Slice scallops in half then quarter. Give the smoked salmon a good chopping. Prepare a breading station consisting of two eggs, bread crumbs and flour. You can add flour and bread crumbs as you need it. Add seafood to mashed potatoes. Give it some Old Bay. Add in the cheese. Combine. Your mashed potatoes are hopefully seasoned, so you won’t have to worry about seasoning them a second time."
- "Using the same method I use for shaping hamburgers (An open ended can on both sides) form the croquettes. These aren’t the traditional shape, but... it’s an improvement in my eyes. After they are formed, carefully dredge in flour, egg and finally bread crumbs while making sure to shake of excess after each stage of the process. Place on a baking sheet, cover with plastic and freeze for about an hour."
- "Place croquettes in hot oil. Should be enough to cover them. Be careful of the splatter... it’s a good investment at the dollar store to get one of these screens. I kept the flame on medium. The mashed potatoes are already cooked, but you want to give the shrimp and scallops time to cook as well as the cheese to melt. If the heat is too high, the breadcrumbs can burn and it’ll be undone in the center."
- "Allow to drain on a wire rack. These are great by themselves but I had it with a little sweet chili sauce."
