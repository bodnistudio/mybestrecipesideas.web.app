recipeinstructions:

- "Pour the vegetable oil into the bowl. Keep mixing with a rubber spatula. Once the mixture becomes a soft dough, wrap it in plastic film and keep kneading."
- "Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Then roll up the dough into small balls (about half the size of a golf ball) and place them on the tray. Bake for 15 min, and leave them to cool without touching. Be careful, the just cooked biscuits are fragile so can easy lose their shape. Serve with a nice cup of tea!"
