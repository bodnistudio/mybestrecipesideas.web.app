recipeingredient:
- "1 liter veggie stock I used two Kallo garlic and herb cubes"
- "1 1/2 cups chopped carrots"
- "1 1/2 cups chopped onions"
- "1 1/2 cupid chopped celery"
- "2 cups chopped potatoes"
- "1 tbs or so tomato paste"
- "2 tsp dried thyme"
- "1 tbs unsalted butter"
- "1 tbs flour"
- "1 tbs olive oil"
- " Sugar optional"
- " Fresh dill for garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a stock pot or large sauce pan, saute carrots, onions, and celery in the olive oil until tender. I know my mirepoix proportions aren&#39;t traditional - you should use what works best for you."
- "Add in the stock, potatoes, tomato paste, and thyme. Stir to make sure the tomato paste is thoroughly combined."
- "Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to let simmer."
- "In a small pan, melt the butter over medium heat, then add in the flour. Whisk thoroughly to combine and then whisk continuously until the roux turns brown and smells nutty, about six minutes or so for me."
- "Turn up the heat on the soup mix and add the roux a bit at a time. Mix to make sure the roux is throughly incorporated, then lower heat to a simmer and reduce to desired thickness -- I go for runny but not watery."
- "My gf likes things a little sweet, so I added about a 1/2 tsp or so of sugar at this point. Personally, I&#39;d leave it out but it does round the taste a bit."
- "Let cool and then refrigerate for at least two hours to let the tastes combine. Reheat, garnish with fresh dill, and serve."
