Think of it like Italian-style &#34;deep dish.&#34; Think of it like Italian-style &#34;deep dish.&#34; Typically served in Torino, pizza al padellino has a thick soft crust, that gets slightly browned on the outside when baking. One of the key misconceptions about Italian pizza is that it is served like a thick cake, deep-dish style. In fact, the crust is one of the most important components of the meal and is traditionally thin but has a fluffy consistency. Within the crust lies the characteristic flavor and exceptional texture found solely in Italian pizza.

Our authentic Italian cuisine is made with the same traditions, recipes and standards that our family has perfected over the years. Our passion for outstanding cuisine and great customer service is a tribute to generations perfecting this. Pizza (Italian: , Neapolitan: ) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.) which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. I have eaten pizza in many countries and had some delicious meals in most of them. But nothing, nothing quite beats the taste and texture of a real Italian Neopolitan style pizza.
