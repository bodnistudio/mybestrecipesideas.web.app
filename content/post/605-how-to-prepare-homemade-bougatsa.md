Bougatsa is a traditional cream-filled phyllo pastry. The cream is a rich custard wrapped in crispy phyllo. Enjoy this pastry for breakfast or along with your cup of coffee. The bougatsa versus galaktoboureko debate is a little more complex. Although both are custard desserts encased in phyllo, one of the major differences is that galaktoboureko is soaked in syrup which is often flavoured with citrus.
