recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the butter into approximately 1.5 cm cubes and chill them in the fridge before you start cooking. If you&#39;re in a rush, cut the butter and chill it in the freezer."
- "Put the ingredients marked with ☆ in a cup to make ice water.  Measure the flour in a bowl, then measure and add the butter, salt and sugar.  Stir well."
- "Use one hand to cut up the chunks of butter with a scraper, and the other hand to get rid of the clumps by mashing the butter and flour, using a rubbing motion."
- "Measure out 2 and 2/3 tablespoons of ice water and add to the mixture, then use the scraper to mix the whole thing into one mass. It&#39;s alright if there is some loose powder left over."
- "Once the majority of the dough has been collected in a ball, cut the dough in half and place it on top of the rest. Repeat so that the dough has 4 layers."
- "Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and flatten it to 1 cm thickness.  Place it in the refrigerator to chill for 2 hours. If you&#39;re going to keep the dough for a long time, place it in the freezer as it is. It will keep for 1 month."
- "You can make this in a food processor too.  In this case, put in the flour, salt and sugar and pulse them together quickly before adding the butter and processing it again vigorously."
- "If the butter becomes powdery, add water and mix until the dough forms.  It&#39;s then finished. Please store it as explained in Step 6."
