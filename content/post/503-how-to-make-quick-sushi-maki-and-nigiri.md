Lay a thin layer of rice on 3/4 of the nori, and then add the peppers, cucumber and salmon on the end with the rice. Roll the Maki carefully, making sure to tuck in the nori as you roll so it stays tight. Roll it up tight and put in the fridge for fifteen minutes. Repeat for the tuna maki, using tuna, pepper, cucumber and avocado."
- "Using a very sharp knife, slice the maki to make small but thick makis. Use any leftover fish to serve as sashimi."
- "Serve with soya sauce, wasabi and pickled ginger. I also had haddock on the side. Enjoy!"
