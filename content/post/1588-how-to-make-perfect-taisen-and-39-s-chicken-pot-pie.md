<h3>Steps to make taisen&#39;s chicken pot pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			the first thing I do is thaw the chicken. if have fresh chicken skip this.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			get 3 pots ready..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			in one pot add the 2 bags of peas and carrots.  add enough water to almost cover them. then add in 3 tablespoons of butter ( or less if you desire ). add in onion powder, pepper, red pepper, garlic powder, and season salt. turn heat up to medium high. turn it low once it starts to boil. simmer it but don&#39;t let it get mushy. you can turn off the heat but keep a little warm..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			in another pot add in 2 of the bullion cubes and sprinkle some poultry seasoning.  add in the chicken.  then add water to cover the chicken. turn heat on and cook until the chicken is done..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			while those two are cooking. take your potatoes , peel and rinse. slice them length wise. then slice those in half. then cut into chunks.  or anyway you want. get them into a pot. add water to cover add in a bit of pepper.  boil for about 10 to 15 minutes or less if you like them more firm.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			to make the crust ( my first attempt for this ) I used 2 cups of bisquick, 1 cup of milk, 2 eggs and 2 teaspoons of melted butter. since it was to thick I added a little extra butter and milk to it. stir very well. this was the top crust.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			if using frozen pie crusts pull them out to thaw for at least 15 minutes.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			once the chicken is done pull it out of the pot to cool down so you can cut it into pieces.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			preheat your oven to 375.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			drain your potatoes.  drain liquid from the peas and carrots..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			pull apart the chicken.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			in a bowl big enough to add everything start adding the peas, carrots, chicken and the cream of chicken.  stir. if it is to thick add a little bit of milk at a time until you reach desired constancy.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			you can now start to fill these pies! you can also taste and add in extra seasoning if you like. I didn&#39;t add my potatoes to one pie so one had them and the other didn&#39;t..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			after filling the pies take the bisquick mixture and carefully put on top. take both pies and put them on a cookie sheet. stick in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes.  keep an eye on them though so they don&#39;t burn..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			pull them out when done. let them settle for about 5 minutes or so then start cutting and making plates. enjoy!.
			
			
		</li>
	
</ol>
