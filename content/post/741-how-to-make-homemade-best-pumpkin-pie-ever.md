		My daughter, Jessica, claims this is the best pumpkin pie she&#39;s ever eaten! —Jacqueline Deibert, Klingerstown, Pennsylvania.
	
		In my opinion, there&#39;s no contest as to which homemade pumpkin pie is best.
	
		No matter how good your canned filling is, it will never match pumpkin pie from scratch.
	
		Creamy, pumpkin custard that&#39;s lightly sweet with just the right balance of spices.
	
		This Pumpkin pie is head and shoulders above all the rest.
