		Most pecan pie recipes I&#39;ve found call for two cups of sugarâ€”one cup of corn syrup plus one cup of either granulated or brown sugar.
	
		I find that just a bit too sweet for my taste, so for this pecan pie recipe, I&#39;ve dropped the sugar down by half a cup.
	
		Feel free to reduce further or add more to your taste.
	
		Combined, these ingredients make for a pie filling that clearly demonstrates why the phrase &#34;ooey-gooey goodness&#34; was invented.
