Made with canned Albacore tuna, peas, pasta shells, and dill. Best of all, it comes coated in a delectable, creamy mayonnaise dressing that cannot be beaten. Add the cooked pasta, tuna, celery, onion, and peas to a large mixing bowl. Pour the dressing on top and toss to coat. If you&#39;d like to make this recipe in advance I would suggest waiting to add the sauce until you&#39;re ready to serve, otherwise the noodles will soak up the sauce and it wont have the creaminess that you want.
