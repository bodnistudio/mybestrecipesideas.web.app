The lovely chewy outsides of these cookies yield to a soft, marzipan-like middle. They&#39;d be perfect served with a bowl of ceremonial-grade matcha or even a frothy matcha latte in the morning (or any time of day, really—I personally make myself a matcha latte every morning using this mix recipe; I make it hot in the winter and iced in the summer). For the dough, I used a very simple eggless sugar cookie recipe not very different from the one used in the Linzer Cookies I made for Valentine&#39;s Day. This dough allows the flavor of the matcha to come through. The vanilla half of the dough combined really well with the matcha half.
