By Monica Matheny Skip the photo tutorial - Jump straight to the recipe. When you don&#39;t have the time or money for a freshly brewed Starbucks vanilla latte, this instant mix is a convenient, affordable option.. The taste of the Instant Caffè Mocha Latte isn&#39;t that great. It lacks flavor (compared to what you buy at an actual Starbucks), but if you need a &#34;quick fix&#34; and can&#39;t get to your local Starbucks for the real thing, it could work.

I previously posted two similar recipes for Vanilla Latte Instant Dry Mix and Pumpkin Spice Latte Instant Dry Mix. This mocha version is similar to my vanilla latte recipe with the addition of cocoa. It can be made vegan by substituting dry coconut or soy dry milk for the dairy dry milk. view on Amazon: Starbucks Instant Cafe Mocha Latte Packets International Café Instant Coffee Inspired by some of your favorite international coffee drinks, these flavored coffee drink mixes make it easy to take a moment for yourself. Simply stir into hot water or milk and enjoy an instant latte, mocha or other coffeehouse favorite.
