Going by weight ratio makes it super-easy to adjust to make just the right amount of concentrate. For the easiest cleanup I use a bowl with a spout for the steeping process and filter it into a Chemex brewer. The process takes longer—most methods call for an overnight steep—and the result is a coffee concentrate that tends to taste less acidic than other iced coffee methods. The concentrate can be kept in the fridge for up to two weeks, and diluted with cold milk, alternative milks like oat milk , or water on ice to drink. Use our Cold Brew Concentrate to easily create authentic and balanced coffee-based iced or frozen specialty drinks, with little or no equipment necessary.
