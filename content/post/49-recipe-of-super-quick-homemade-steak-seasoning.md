Hey everyone, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, steak seasoning. One of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Harissa is the perfect way to add a savory, spicy flavor to your steak. Create the rub by soaking four large, dried, mild chiles until they&#39;re softened. Then, blend the chiles with a stemmed and seeded Thai chili, two cloves of garlic, a quarter cup olive oil and a teaspoon each kosher salt, ground cumin, ground coriander and caraway seeds.

Steak seasoning is one of the most favored of recent trending foods on earth. It's enjoyed by millions every day. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look wonderful. Steak seasoning is something which I have loved my entire life.


To begin with this recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook steak seasoning using 10 ingredients and 2 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

Rub - This seasoning makes a great dry rub. Sprinkle each side of your meat evenly with seasoning, and gentle rub in the seasoning to completely coat all of your meat. This seasoning is pretty simple to make and will last for months if sealed in an airtight container. I like to buy small glass jars that are easy to label and re-use.

If you want a more bold seasoning blend, try my homemade steak rub with a kick of cayenne and red pepper flakes (inspired by my dad) or my Montreal Steak seasoning for a combination of flavors that works well for beef, chicken. I started making my own steak seasoning so it is free of non-caking additives, and other such abominations, and I could control the amount of each spice added to it. I can be picky and I like mine spicier than they make it so that means my home version contains more red pepper flakes than is humanly necessary! When to apply the salt is a common seasoning question. Others say salting it right before cooking is best.
