I love cooking with beer, but never thought to add whiskey before. I used minced garlic from a jar instead of garlic powder and instead of Sam Adam&#39;s used Michelob Ultra. I think any type of full bodied beer will work fine in this recipe. For the steaks: Sprinkle both sides of the steak with lemon pepper, seasoned salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste, then allow the mixture to bubble up and reduce by half.
