- "Assembly: On a lightly floured surface, roll the chilled dough into a thickness of 3/4-inch (0.5 cm)."
- "Using the same size cookie cutter as the tart mold, cut as many circles as possible from the dough. I used 2Â¾-inches (7 cm) tart mold and cookie cutter."
- "Gently press each cut-out into the tart molds."
- "Prick the bottom of each tart shell with a fork for about 10 times. These holes will allow steam to release from the dough while baking and prevent it from puffing up."
- "Pour the custard filling into the tart shell. Fill each up to 75%."
- "Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of custard can stand on its own. If the custard filling cooks too quickly and bubbles up, open the oven door a little for about 10 seconds."
