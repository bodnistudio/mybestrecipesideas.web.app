Poha or pressed rice makes for a common breakfast recipe and these Pressed Rice Pancakes are a delightful change to the regular poha recipe. These pancakes are similar to tikkis or cutlets. I used brown rice as that&#39;s the only kind of rice I eat. I made it in my Instant Pot, which produces a slightly stickier rice than cooking on the stove top.

When everything is mixed in I carefully let the rice fry by pressing it into the pan. I stirred the mixture again and pressed again but very quickly.
