Head to the store and pick up green onions, avocados, cucumber, and a few other things to make it today. Not a lot of people really liked this Mexican dish. In this soup, I combine crispy cucumber with avocado, some lime juice, green onions, and a little sea salt to create a perfectly dreamy, cool soup. If you&#39;ve got a little more time on your hands, you can also throw together an easy mango salsa, which is delightful stirred into the soup or as a garnish on.
