recipeingredient:
- "1 cup warm water"
- "3 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "3 tablespoons sugar"
- "1 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1 teaspoon oregano"
- "1/2 teaspoon finely chopped chili"
- "1 teaspoon basil"
- "1 cup cake flour"
- "2 cups white bread flour"
- " For the topping"
- "2 chicken breasts skinned deboned and sliced into strips"
- "1 1/2 cups sliced mushrooms"
- "1 punnet asparagus roughly chopped"
- "1 medium onion sliced"
- "1 red pepper sliced julienne style"
- "1 tablespoon crushed garlic"
- "3 tablespoons olive oil"
- "2 medium chili finely chopped"
- "to taste Grated cheddar cheese"
- "to taste Grated mozzarella cheese"
- "to taste Mediterranean spice OR chicken spice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place dough ingredients in bread maker in the order given by the manufacturer of your machine. Select dough cycle"
- "While your machine is doing its thing for you, put a little oil into a pan and heat. Add chicken, onion, and Mediterranean spice, cook until chicken is no longer pink on the outside. Add chopped asparagus and cook for approximately 5 minutes. You want the asparagus cooked but not soggy. Put it aside."
- "In a cup or small bowl, mix together the olive oil chopped chili and crushed garlic. Put aside"
- "When dough is ready, roll it out to fit either a roasting pan or a pizza pan. I actually use a aluminum tray that my husband altered to fit in my oven. Line the pan with non-stick baking paper. I like a very thin crust so at this stage I work fairly quickly so as not to allow the dough time to raise again. If you like a thicker crust, once you&#39;ve placed the dough into the pan, cover and leave to raise for a maximum of 20 minutes"
- "Spread the tomato relish on the base, then place your chicken mixture on top of the relish. Place the red pepper slices on top, then the cheddar, then the mozzarella. Remember although it give a nice flavour, cheddar is very oily. I use much more mozzarella than cheddar."
- "Sprinkle the chili garlic mixture on top of cheese as evenly as you can"
- "Bake at 200 degrees Celsius for 15 to 20 minutes. The cheese must be bubbling and the crust edges crisp."
- "Don&#39;t through excess dough away - shape into a little loaf, let it raise, sprinkle some herbs, garlic, salt on top and bake for about 15/20 minutes at 190 degrees Celsius depending on the size of the little loaf"
