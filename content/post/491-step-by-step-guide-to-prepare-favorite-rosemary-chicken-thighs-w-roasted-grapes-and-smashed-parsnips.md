Rosemary, garlic, and oregano create a mouth watering aroma and the potatoes are crispy like french fries. If I make this again and use chicken thighs I&#39;ll revise my review. However, I used chicken breast and overall the dish tasted bland to me. An all-in-one lighter roast with Jersey Royals and a whole bulb of garlic - the potatoes catch the lemony cooking juices, from BBC Good Food. For tender an flavorful chicken thighs, try this marinade of olive oil, garlic, hone an rosemary.
