Meat Sauce for pasta is traditionally made with spaghetti, but it goes really well with any of these: String Pastas - Spaghetti, Linguine, Fettuccine Ribbon Pastas - Pappardelle or Tagliatelle Tubular Pastas - Penne, Cannelloni, Rigatoni, Ziti In all seriousness, this Best Ever Spaghetti and Meat Sauce is the perfect Italian-inspired family meal idea - the sauce is rich and meaty and SO flavourful, and it goes great over your favourite pasta cooked in salted water. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and marinara sauce. Stir to combine, then add oregano, thyme, sugar, salt, bay leaves, and crushed red pepper (if using). Stir, then add cooked ground beef and stir to combine. Brown beef, stirring occasionally (I was always taught to stir constantly but this makes your beef gray, let it brown on bottom and only stir occasionally) and breaking up beef as you stir, until cooked through.
