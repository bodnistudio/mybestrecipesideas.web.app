Commercial ground beef consists of leftover trimmings from steaks and roasts. Unless you have a great neighborhood butcher who does everything in-house, it&#39;s hard to know exactly what goes into your blend. Making a shallow indentation in the center of the patty is the first step toward a great burger. The collagen, or connective tissue, in ground meat shrinks when heated. This causes the bottom and sides of the meat to tighten like a belt, which forces the surface of the burger to expand.
