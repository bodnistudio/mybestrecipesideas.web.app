TIP: If you like a modern twist, use Kühne Made for Meat Chipotle Burger Style sauce instead of ketchup and add some bacon. Here&#39;s what he had to say about Field Roast Mexican Chipotle Sausages: To begin, these sausages were wrapped up in a plastic casing like real-meat sausage links. A word of warning: the casing did not entirely contain the bright red juice these sausages are infused with and it seems like it could stain if not dealt with in a timely fashion. AP flour, egg, corn meal, diced steamed broccoli, chorizo sausage diced and fried, grated cheese of choice, water, chipotle spice Patricia Mcfarland. Put a non-stick pan over a medium heat then add the sausages.
