- "In another pan heat oil and cook the chopped onion."
- "Then add the eggs and cook them. When these are completely cooked add the salsa and keep cooking for 1.5 minutes to heat the salsa."
- "To serve, put the tortillas over a bed of rice, and then put the eggs over the tortillas. You can add more salsa if you want. Eat with fork and knife. Enjoy."

My fiancé has been begging me to make huevos rancheros for him, and this came out just like he hoped it would! I did use store-bought salsa, though, and scrambled my eggs with cumin and cilantro instead of frying them, which gave the dish some extra flavor. Add olive oil to a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté for a few minutes.

We fry two tortillas into hard tostadas. We fry our eggs Spanish style - heated oil in low heat, as the egg solidifies we spoon the hot oil over the eggs to cook from above, but leave the yolk runny. We lay the eggs on the tostadas and heat salsa over the eggs. Serve with refried beans, Spanish rice and heated tortillas. Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat them together.
