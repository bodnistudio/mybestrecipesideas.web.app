While Louisianans have firm ideas about what goes into a proper gumbo, there are infinite variations—chicken and okra; turkey and sausage; duck, oyster, and sausage—and countless versions, including ones with filé as a. This authentic little recipe uses the king of all sausages, spicy andouille sausage, with shrimp and traditional gumbo fixings. Simmering the shrimp shells in the broth adds distinct flavor, but you can skip this step and start with peeled shrimp. In a large, deep skillet over medium-low heat, melt butter, then add flour. Make the gumbo base: In a heavy-bottomed soup pot, heat olive oil over medium-high heat.
