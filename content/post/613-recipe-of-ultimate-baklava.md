Hello everybody, hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, baklava. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Baklava is one of the most favored of current trending meals on earth. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It's appreciated by millions every day. Baklava is something that I've loved my entire life. They're fine and they look wonderful.

CUT the baklava after assembly and before cooking, and top with butter to make everything smooth and &#34;pretty&#34;. Put the cooled sauce on as soon as you pull the baklava out of the oven. It tastes like the baklava I buy in the Greek stores downtown and a LOT cheaper per piece.
