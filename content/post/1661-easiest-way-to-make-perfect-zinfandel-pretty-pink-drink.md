Once thought to be native to California, the dark blue zinfandel grape can be used to make bold red wine or &#34;white zin,&#34; a pink, affordable wine. While made from the same grapes, the two wines are distinctively different in flavor, body, sweetness, alcohol content, and price. And then there&#39;s white Zinfandel, the light and sweet wine made from red Zinfandel grapes (the only kind) but vinified as rosé, so the pink juice of the freshly pressed grapes is separated quickly from the inky skins. White Zinfandel is increasingly blended with other wines to add color and aromatics to the final product.

POSTED BY Sutter Home FOR SUTTER HOME. How Red Zinfandel compares to other red wines. Zinfandel is lighter in color than both Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. However, although a light-bodied red wine like Pinot Noir, Zin&#39;s moderate tannin and high acidity make it taste bold. Zinfandel can be vinified into red and rosé wines.
