- "Broil until cheese is melted, bubbly and starting to brown."
- "Serve immediately!"
- "Tips- Any cut of steak will do. I partially freeze mine, then cut it in extremely thin slices. You can also get your butcher to shave it for you. My favorite steak to use for this is ribeye .   To make it spicer add additional red pepper flakes or an additional jalapeno.   If you want it spicy leave the seeds in the jalapeno, if you want to tame the spicy just a bit remove the seeds and cut back on the red pepper flakes."
