		</li>

		Fish Pie is a good way to make a little fish go a long way for a growing family.
	
		How to make Low Calorie Fish Pie For this recipe I use ordinary ingredients that you can buy at the supermarket Fish is naturally low in calories but a great source of protein.
	
		To the uninitiated, fish pie has an uninviting name and reputation But this is fish that is gently poached, then swathed in a white sauce and topped with buttery mashed potatoes and finished to a heat-bronzed finish in the oven It is a dish good for children but can be made into unapologetic dinner-party fare by poaching the fish in a little white wine, making the white sauce with light cream.
	
		Combining fish, leeks, milk, butter, and potatoes, a fish pie is a one-pot supper dish.
	
		Some like to sprinkle a fish pie with grated cheese but that&#39;s optional, as is the addition of hard-cooked eggs seen in some recipes.
