Otherwise known as that yogurt and cucumber sauce you love at Greek restaurants but worry about mispronouncing (hear the correct pronunciation here). Tzatziki is made simply with yogurt, drained cucumber, olive oil, fresh herbs (usually mint or dill), garlic, lemon juice and salt. This is so close to the reciper we used in cooking class in greece!, we were taught to shredded the cucumber like a block of cheese then salt let sit while the rest is put together then grab a handuful at a time and squeezed out all the water and then mix it into the dip. it may be an idea to keep in mind if you want some and dont have a half hour to wait on it draining LOVED your tzatziki Anette! At last, a proper tzatziki, just the way we make this in Greece. The only difference is that we mostly use red wine vinegar here, instead of white, but the taste is pretty much the same.
