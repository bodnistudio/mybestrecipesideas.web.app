I was born and raise in Alexandria, Egypt where lots of Greek and Armenian communities lived, this was a well know Greek pie called &#34;Pasta Flora&#34; it was always made with apricot jam. Do you suppose I could substitute jam or even chopped dried apricot soaked in either apple or orange juice instead of fresh as it is the shortest seasonal fruit. Despite the name, pasta flora, this is not a pasta dish! Pasta flora is actually a well loved Greek jam tart, made with whatever jam you fancy. Greeks aren&#39;t big on breakfast, but a slice of this is a favourite mid-morning.
