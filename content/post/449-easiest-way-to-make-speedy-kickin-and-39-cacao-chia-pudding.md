<h3>Steps to make Kickin&#39; Cacao Chia Pudding:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			You can leave your chia seeds whole, if you want a more &#34;tapioca&#34; type texture, but since this is &#34;chocolate&#34; pudding, I grind the chia seeds first. Sadly, I could not get them to grind at all with my granite mortar and pestle (like I do flax), so I use the flat blade of my MagicBullet. A clean electric coffee grinder or any flat blade processor could also be used..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Blend all ingredients together (I use regular blade on MB for this), then pour into small glass jars or serving bowls. I make 2-3 servings with this recipe..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Add pecan pieces, if desired. Then enjoy the creamy, chocolatey, healthy goodness!.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			&#34;Pumpkin spice&#34; is: 4 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp ginger, 1 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp allspice, all ground (of course!).
			
			
		</li>
	
</ol>
