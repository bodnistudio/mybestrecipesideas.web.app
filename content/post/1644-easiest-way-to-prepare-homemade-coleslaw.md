Hey everyone, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, coleslaw. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Coleslaw is one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It's easy, it is fast, it tastes delicious. They are nice and they look fantastic. Coleslaw is something which I have loved my whole life.

To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have coleslaw using 7 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Coleslaw:

1. Prepare  cabbage
1. Take  carrots
1. Take  cucumber
1. Take  tomatoes
1. Make ready  eggs
1. Make ready  Salad cream
1. Get  tea spns of sugar


Start with the best coleslaw ingredients. Green cabbage is the classic slaw base, though red cabbage&#39;s peppery flavor and pretty color make it pleasant addition. Both are smooth-leaved, dense, and crunchy (unlike Napa cabbage, which is very popular in Asian cooking, and savoy cabbages, which have a much more subtle flavor and less-assertive. This coleslaw is a great side dish to bring to summer potlucks, and pairs well with recipes like Slow Cooker Pulled Pork, tacos (especially fish tacos), lunch wraps with deli meat, hot dogs, and more.

I don&#39;t recommend it, as raw cabbage does not freeze well. Make coleslaw dressing: In a small mixing bowl whisk together the mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar and honey. If needed season with a bit of salt. Pour dressing over shredded cabbage mixture: Place shredded coleslaw mix in a large bowl then pour the dressing mixture over. Toss together: Toss to evenly coat.
