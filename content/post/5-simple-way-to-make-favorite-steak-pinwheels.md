Hello everybody, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, steak pinwheels. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Steak pinwheels is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods on earth. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes yummy. It's appreciated by millions every day. They're fine and they look wonderful. Steak pinwheels is something which I have loved my whole life.

The combination of the marinade, spinach, onion and feta make this a delicious and impressive flank steak recipe that is always a huge hit for guests! Easy to prepare (but it doesn&#39;t look like it is), great tasting and pretty to look at too! Open meat so it lies flat; cover with plastic wrap.

##### The ingredients needed to make Steak pinwheels:

1. Make ready 1 lb sirloin tip steak
1. Take 2 cups freshly shredded Parmesan cheese
1. Get 1/4 cup diced fresh cilantro
1. Prepare 1 tsp onion powder
1. Get 2 tbs Worcester sauce
1. Make ready 1 tsp Italian seasoning
1. Get 1 tsp meat tenderizer
1. Get 3 tbs olive oil
1. Make ready 1 box beef broth


This recipe uses a less expensive but flavorful cut of beef to form single-serving pinwheels stuffed with Parmesan and parsley, and a boost of flavor from garlic, rosemary and lemon. A skirt steak is ideal to use because it is already thin and long enough to roll like a jellyroll. According to The Beef Checkoff, significant research shows that some people can lose and/or maintain a healthy weight, support a healthy metabolism, and age more vibrantly when they consume more high-quality protein, within calorie goals. Beef - Sirloin butterflied and pounded out thin is an excellent substitute.

Ask your butcher if they have thin cut pieces to save some time. Pesto - A nice thick pesto or just a whole bunch of basil leaves gives nice color and flavor to these flank steak rolls. Prosciutto and provolone - Alternatives such as mortadella, ham and mozzarella work. Starting at the short ends, roll each skirt steak into a pinwheel. Flank steak is one of those items I keep in stock in the deep freezer since its so fast to cook, inexpensive and versatile.
