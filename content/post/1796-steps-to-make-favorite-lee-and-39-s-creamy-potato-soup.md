- "Add diced potatoes, chicken stock, and milk. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let cook until potatoes are fork tender. 13-15 minutes Do not bring to a full boil. Note: This is the time to season with salt."
- "When potatoes are fork tender, add half and half. Bring back to a simmer. Then add cornstarch slurry. (1/4 Cup warm water and 1 tablespoon cornstarch well blended) Bring back to a simmer."
