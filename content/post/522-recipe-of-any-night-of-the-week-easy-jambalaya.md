I added a few more spices in the end because it was a little heavy on the tomato flavor. Jambalaya, a one-pot New Orleans favorite, always includes meat or seafood and vegetables; this easy rendition is full of chicken, spicy andouille sausage, bell pepper, and onion. Served over rice or rice cooked with the jambalaya for one pot meal. A somewhat classic version but a great addition to the site since you all love the Cajun Jambalaya Pasta on here so much!
