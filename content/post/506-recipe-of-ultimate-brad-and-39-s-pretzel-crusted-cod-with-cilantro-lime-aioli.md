This cilantro, jalapeno, and garlic aioli is surprisingly versatile as a dressing, topping or dip. Blend mayonnaise, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, garlic, lime juice, cumin, and salt together in a blender or food processor until smooth. Now I am making it again tonight for baked cod. Most of the recipes I looked up for cornmeal crusted shrimp were prepared by frying them, but I found that baking them still produced that crispy exterior that you get when they&#39;re fried. The bright fresh flavor of this aioli is the perfect dipping sauce for these crispy, crunchy baked cornmeal crusted shrimp!
