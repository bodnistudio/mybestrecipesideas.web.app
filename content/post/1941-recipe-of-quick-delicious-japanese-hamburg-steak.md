recipeinstructions:
- "＊All the ingredient except vegetables and red wine should be cool because it makes the hamburg juicy."
- "＊＊Panko is a Japanese breadcrumbs. Instead of panko, you can use a few slices of bread. Keep the slices of bread in a freezer overnight and take them out when you start cooking. Cut flakily like the photo using a grater or a knife. Bake flaked bread in a oven for a few minutes if you feel the bread is moist."
- "Chop onion and garlic. Saute chopped onion and garlic with 15g of butter. Stop sauteing before they get brown. Transfer to a plate to cool completely."
- "Mix ingredients with ◯ mark (Panko, 1/2 cup of milk, salt and black pepper) in a big bowl."
- "Mix onion, garlic and minced beef and pork into the bowl in 2. Add 1/2 cup of milk if you think the meat is hard. Do it quickly with hands!"
- "Wrap the bowl in plastic wrap. Keep it in fridge for hours so that the hamburg is juicier."

- "Put the 15g of the butter in a frying pan. Put over a high flame and wait a few minutes until it melts."
- "Put 2 or 3 pieces of hamburger meat in the heated frying pan."
- "First, fry each side of the meat until it begins to brown. Then, fry each side over a low flame."
- "Push lightly on the surface of the meat. If clear meat juice comes out, it is time to transfer the meat into a dish."
- "Wipe lightly the surface of the frying pan with a piece of kitchen paper. Put the 15 g of the butter and the rest of the meat in the pan and fry (do step 8 and 9 again). Transfer the meat into a dish."
- "Reuse the pan which was used to fry the meat. Add Knorr Demi-Glace sauce powder, 1 cup of red wine and 1/2 cup of water and simmer for 5 minutes. (If you don&#39;t like to add red wine, it&#39;s fine! Follow the instruction on the package of Knorr Demi-Glace sauce. But remember that red wine can remove the smell of the meat.)"
- "Mix 50g of ketchup in the pan. Add a little Worcestershire sauce and sugar if you would like to. The hamburg sauce is ready."
- "Return the hamburger meat in the frying pan. pour the sauce on the meat with a spoon. It&#39;s good to cover the pan with the lid and simmer 1-2 minutes if you have time."
- "Put the hamburg and the sauce in the dish. Put a garnish if you would like to."
- "Enjoy the meal:)"
