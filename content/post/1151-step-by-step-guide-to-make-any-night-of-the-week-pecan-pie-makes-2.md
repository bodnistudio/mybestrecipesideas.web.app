Hey everyone, it is Brad, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, pecan pie , makes 2. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

##### The ingredients needed to make Pecan pie , makes 2:

1. Make ready  crushed pecans
1. Get  sugar
1. Take  brown sugar
1. Get  salt
1. Make ready  melted butter
1. Prepare  beaten eggs
1. Get  corn syrup
1. Get  vanilla


Most pecan pie recipes I&#39;ve found call for two cups of sugarâ€”one cup of corn syrup plus one cup of either granulated or brown sugar. I find that just a bit too sweet for my taste, so for this pecan pie recipe, I&#39;ve dropped the sugar down by half a cup. Feel free to reduce further or add more to your taste. Combined, these ingredients make for a pie filling that clearly demonstrates why the phrase &#34;ooey-gooey goodness&#34; was invented. (We even check the temperature toward the end of baking to make sure it hits the perfect ooey-gooey goodness we&#39;re after.) Along with a double handful of pecans.

How to Make Pecan Pie Without Corn Syrup. But then I made pecan pie both ways and the one with golden syrup, dark brown sugar and deeply toasted nuts was not even on the same level, it doesn&#39;t even feel fair to compare them. These three things will send your pecan pie game into the stratosphere, into the otherwordly realm.
