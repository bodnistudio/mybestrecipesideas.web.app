You pretty much just cook the beef, shallots, garlic and peppers before seasoning with the perfect balance of salty fish sauce, sweet palm sugar. Basilâ€”using Thai holy basil (if you&#39;re lucky enough to find it) makes this spicy beef stir-fry worthy of the name &#34;phat ka-phrao&#34; which means &#34;holy basil stir-fry&#34;. If you can&#39;t find Thai holy basil (it can be hard to track down) just use sweet basil. Extremely flavorful, very simple and fresh. My version of Thai Beef Basil I usually get from take-out.
