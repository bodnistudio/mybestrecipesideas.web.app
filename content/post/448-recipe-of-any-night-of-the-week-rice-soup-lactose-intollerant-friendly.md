No Lactose: You may eat or drink these lactose free dairy foods any time. Canned nutrition drinks made with soy instead of milk, such as Ensure™ Lactose free milk; Non-dairy creamers (read labels to be sure) Rice milk drinks; Soymilks; Do not eat or drink the following dairy foods because they contain lactose. A diagnosis of lactose intolerance means that your body lacks the ability to digest lactose, a sugar that occurs naturally in cow&#39;s milk. This will perk you up on a cold, rainy day. You can use chicken in place of turkey, and I like to serve the potpies with a fresh green salad or cranberry sauce on the side, but there are lots of other dairy-free foods you could serve with it too. —Judy Wilson, Sun City West, Arizona Lactose is a simple sugar in milk that many people have trouble digesting.
