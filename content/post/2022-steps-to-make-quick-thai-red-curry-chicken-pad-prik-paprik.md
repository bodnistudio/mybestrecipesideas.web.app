Usually stir fried with chicken or beef and personally I love with beef because the pungent spicy red curry and green beans goes SO well with beef! I&#39;m SO excited today because I&#39;m about to share my new FAV Thai food, Pan Prik King recipe with you!!. Red Curry Paste is made for the more liquid style Thai Red Curry which is saucier and not so dry, often cooked with coconut milk. The two pastes are NOT the same and their tastes. Add the chicken, turn up the heat to medium-high, and start stir frying constantly, mix the chicken with the curry paste.
