Chopped Asparagus Salad, is a healthy gluten free bean salad perfect for spring ~ add some great canned tuna and hard cooked eggs to make it a main course salad. This no mayo salad is great for barbecues and picnics! Combine beans, asparagus, watercress, mint, and tarragon in a large bowl; add vinaigrette and pistachios and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving platter and top with chive blossoms, if using. Thick-stemmed asparagus is best for this flavorful, intensely green salad; thin asparagus would be a bit wimpy.
