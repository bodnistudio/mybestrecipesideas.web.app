- "25 grams butter"
- "150 ml green tea lukewarm and well stewed"
- "1/2 tbsp Nigella seeds"
- "1/2 tbsp Sesame seeds"

recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the flour, yeast and sugar together."

Win a family ticket for four to Christmas At Blenheim Palace! Christmas at Blenheim Palace returns for its fifth year with a new magical one-mile glittering trail that winds its way through the world-famous Parkland Fold in the sesame seeds. Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan and sprinkle more white and black sesame seeds over the top. Allow to cool before slicing and serving or storing in an airtight container. &#34;Swirled Sesame Tea Cake&#34; not only incorporates tahini in its batter, but plenty of black and white sesame seeds all over its exterior, along with a sprinkle of sugar, which will turn the cake deeply golden brown after baking. The swirl is created by reserving half of the batter to mix in ground black sesame seeds.
