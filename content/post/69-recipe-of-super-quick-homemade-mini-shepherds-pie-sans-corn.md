	<strong>Mini “Shepherds Pie” (Sans Corn)</strong>. 
	Expect the best shepherd&#39;s pie, casserole with ground beef, chopped carrots, corn, and peas, topped with mashed potatoes. This tastes so much better than the regular shepherds pie u get. I think its because it caters to asian taste buds as well.
