PASTA: short pasta like fusilli, conchiglie, farfalle, penne work fine. However, have a proper look at the label and go for durum wheat semolina pasta, it&#39;s a bit more expensive than basic pasta, but it&#39;s resilient and has a more robust texture, the best choice when it. This summery dish walks the line between tangy, juicy tomato salad and hearty pasta salad To make it, ripe tomatoes are marinated with capers, garlic, basil and lots of good olive oil until they almost fall apart, creating a wonderfully soupy dressing for the pasta Then the pasta is added while still hot to mix; as it cools, it absorbs all the bright flavors Yesterday, after a weekend of brisket, chocolate cake, and innumerable other naughty delights, suddenly all I wanted was a cold, healthy salad. I eventually came to my senses and decided to include pasta in the mix, and threw in tomatoes, zucchini, andâ€”the best partâ€”lots of feta cheese. The best part about this tomato pasta salad is that it tastes juicy, flavourful and fresh any time of the year.
