		This pecan pie recipe impressed me from beginning to end.
	
		Most pecan pie recipes I&#39;ve found call for two cups of sugar—one cup of corn syrup plus one cup of either granulated or brown sugar.
	
		I find that just a bit too sweet for my taste, so for this pecan pie recipe, I&#39;ve dropped the sugar down by half a cup.
	
		Feel free to reduce further or add more to your taste.
