- "Butter an ovenproof dish and place the fish pieces at the bottom. Squeeze over a little lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 200C/Gas 6."
- "Cover the fish completely with creme fraiche, smoothing over the top to make an airtight layer, only use as much creme fraiche as you need."
