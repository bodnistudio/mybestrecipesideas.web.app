La película La pasión de Cristo, en inglés The passion of Christ, tiene como actores principales a Jim Caviezel como Jesús de Nazaret y a Maia Morgenstern como la Virgen María. Para dar más realismo, la película fue rodada en arameo, latín y hebreo, las lenguas corrientes en tiempos de Jesús. La palabra pasión deriva del latín passio que significa &#34;sufrir&#34;, que a su vez es de la familia ligada al verbo &#34;padecer&#34; y de raíz etimológica en común con &#34;paciencia&#34;. Conociendo el origen de pasión podemos comprender mejor la usanza antigua de la palabra en el lenguaje cristiano como, por ejemplo, la pasión de Cristo o Domingo de pasión. Acusado de traición a Roma, Cristo es entregado a Poncio Pilato, quien, para evitar un motín, lo condena a a morir en la cruz como un vulgar criminal.
