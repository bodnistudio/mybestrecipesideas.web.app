recipeingredient:
- "1 1/4 lbs lean ground pork"
- "1 medium onion thinly sliced"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "1/2 cup rice wine vinegar"
- "4 tbsp fish sauce"
- "4 tbsp packed brown sugar"
- "1 Thai chilli finely sliced optional"
- "2-7 oz. packages precooked udon noodles"
- "2 large stalks of kale leaves stripped and chopped"
- "1 medium carrot finely grated"
- "2 stalks celery finely chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add a splash of veg oil to a large pan on medium-high heat. Crumble the pork into the pan and then don&#39;t touch it for 5 minutes. Seriously, you want to leave it alone so the meat can caramelize and start forming a crust. When the 5 minutes are up, use a wooden spoon to break the meat up further."
- "After an additional 5 minutes the pork should be pretty much cooked. Add the onion and garlic to the pan and turn down the heat to medium. Give the meat a stir every so often as you prep the sauce and noodles."
- "In a bowl, whisk together.the vinegar, fish sauce, sugar and chilli. Fill a medium pot with water and put it on high heat. When it comes to a boil, turn off the heat and drop in the udon."
- "Once the udon noodles break apart (about 2 minutes) drain and add them to the pan of meat along with the kale. Let cook 1 minute, just until the kale softens a bit. Stir in the carrot and celery."
- "Pour the sauce into the pan and toss everything together. It&#39;ll seem overly wet at first, but the noodles will drink up most of the sauce, which will also thicken into almost a glaze. Serve hot."
