From Huntsville, Alabama, though I learned to make and fell in love with tomato gravy over grits, especially for dinner while living &amp; going to school in Mobile; however, I chop &amp; brown the pork sausage like ground beef then add tomatoes &amp; sausage back once roux is ready. Add the sausage and enough water to cover the sausage at the half-way mark. Cook over medium heat until the water boils down and the sausage browns. Turn over and repeat the browning process.
