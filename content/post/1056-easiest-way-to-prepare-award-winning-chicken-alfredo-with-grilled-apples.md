The trick to jerk chicken is nailing the flavor and consistency of the marinade. It should be paste-y, but not too thick and not too thin. This recipe starts with making the marinade, proceeds with cooking the chicken, and then mixes the chicken into a delicious Alfredo sauce to give it a Caribbean flavor.
