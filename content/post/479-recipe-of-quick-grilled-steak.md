- " Black Pepper"
- " Cajun Seasoning"
- " Creole Seasoning"
- "1 pk Sazon"
- " Garlic Powder"
- " Onion Salt"
- " Hoisin Sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Salt your steak with a few pinches of kosher salt on both sides. Don’t be shy, about three healthy pinches. Put steak into the fridge for about 15 minutes. This will draw out some moisture and tenderize the meat."
- "Remove steak from fridge and pat dry with paper towels. Combine all dry seasonings and whisk together. Rub steak on both sides with spices. Lastly, squirt Hoisin sauce like you would dress a hot dog and rub it in. Don’t overdo it. It’s a little sweet and could burn."
- "Place steak directly on grill. I had some mesquite wood chips that I soaked in water and added to the coals. Try not to play with the steak. I left it alone for about 10-12 minutes before flipping. You don’t want the steak over flames or super hot heat. You want it hot, but not flaming. Flip steak, cook it for a little more than half the time on the other side. You’re shooting for about 145F (internal temperature). Shoot for a higher temp if depending on how you like your steak."
- "After resting, cut up and serve with whatever you like."
- "Excuse my foot in the photo lol. I had mine like this."
