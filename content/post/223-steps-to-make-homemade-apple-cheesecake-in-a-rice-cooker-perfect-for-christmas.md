Similar to the aforementioned Japanese pancakes, the cheesecake mixture is poured into the rice cooker, left to cook and then turned out onto a platter. The ultimate dorm room dish, mac and cheese is even easier with a rice cooker. In Terri Gage Foster&#39;s recipe for Easy Mac &#39;n Cheese, macaroni noodles are cooked down in milk and broth, then a trio of cheeses are stirred in at the end. If you&#39;re looking to go beyond the basics, many reviewers suggested adding seasonings like garlic or onion powder, dried mustard, and red pepper flakes. It&#39;s fluffy, delicate and absolutely delicious.
