- "Alternatives can be made - instead of oriental flavors, you could use extra breadcrumb instead of sesame seeds and put fajita seasoning instead of Thai spice, or use Indian spices and serve with home made raita to dip."
- "Once cooked, leave to cool for 5 minutes. I served mine in a wrap with salad and garlic yoghurt, but it would also go brilliantly with wedges."
