Fish and meat often figure prominently in the Vietnamese meal-in-a-bowl soup known as pho, but there are traditional and fine vegetarian options, chief. Since I became vegan last year, I&#39;ve been scouring the internet for kid-friendly vegan recipes â€”not only because I want to build a repertoire of easy vegan meals that my meat-eating nieces will love, but because some of my favorite comfort foods are classic childhood dishes, like pepperoni pizza and mac and cheese. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love a good sweet potato and quinoa burrito as. These kid-friendly recipes are pulled from amazing bloggers across the net.
