- "Place meat in smoker. No need to flip these ribs at any point but, seal tightly and regulate temperature at 250¬∞."
- "Fully vent your smoker and let her smoke at 250¬∞ for 2 to 2.5 hours. Or, until meat visibly pulls away from your bones."
- "When meat begins pulling from its&#39; bones - you&#39;ll know they&#39;re just about ready. Serve naked or, with your favorite BBQ Sauce. Just don&#39;t add sauce while meat is on your smoker grill grids. A smoker is much different from a grill and, much more temperamental to clean. Add sauce only AFTER meat is pulled from your clean smoker grids."

- "If desired, plate and coat your ribs with your favorite BBQ Sauce outside of your smoker. Or, just go naked with your dry rub. Here, in the Q, we do adore our Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce! Anyway, feel free to serve with warmed, crispy French Bread, baked beans, a very chilly, fresh wedge salad and, my crazy delicious French Honey Butter Spread recipe listed on this site. Enjoy your incredibly easy &amp; simplistic taste of US South in your sweet little mouth! üòÜ"
