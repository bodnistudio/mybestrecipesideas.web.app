<h3>Steps to make Fruit Explosion Carrot  Muffins:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Make fruit spread. Mix all ingredients together In a pot.  bring to a boil and allow to simmer and break down and thicken. Pull out vanilla pods. With an immersion blender  or potato masher process till desired consistency. Allow to cool. Will make about two 16 oz jars. Keep one in fridge and one in freezer. Great to spread on toast, add to plain yogurt, top pancakes, make bars...etc..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Alternatively you can skip this step all together and just add 1/2 cup on Apple sauce to muffins or cut up fruit. And then your favourite jam for the center of the muffins..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In blender throw all the muffins ingredients except the fold ins and blend. It doesn&#39;t have to be completey smooth..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Fold in the add ins, scoop 1/4 cup into sprayed muffins tins. Add 1 spoonful of the reserved fruit spread on top of each muffin, then top with another 1/4 cup batter. Makes large fruit explosion muffins! Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar topping. Bake 375 17-22 mins. Allow to cool in pan on rack for at least 5 mins. They are moist muffins, best kept in fridge if they last past a day in your house. I made 12 smaller muffins and 12 mini muffins..
