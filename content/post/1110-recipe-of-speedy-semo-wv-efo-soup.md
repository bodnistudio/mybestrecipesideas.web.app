Today I made Efo Riro which is one of my favorite vegetable soups. &#34;Efo riro&#34; is a Yoruba word which simply means &#34;Vegetable soup&#34; and it&#39;s enjoyed by many. This is because it&#39;s really versatile and could be eaten with meals such as Rice, Yam and any type of Swallow. I often get questions on how to make oil- free Nigerian soups. Honestly, It&#39;s really as simple as just skipping the oil; there is no magic trick to it. In the case of efo-riro for example, oil serves two purposes.
