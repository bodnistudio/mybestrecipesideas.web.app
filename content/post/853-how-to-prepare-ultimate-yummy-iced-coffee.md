If you need a few delicious treats to have with your coffee, you might consider baking some Brown Sugar Cinnamon Biscotti or Lemon Tea Cake. Iced coffee is a complicated thing, and there are many different approaches. One would think that one could merely pour brewed coffee into a glass full of ice and call it a dayâ€¦but I find that method extremely flawed. First, no matter how packed with ice the glass is, once the hot coffee hits, some of the ice is bound to melt. I think it&#39;s awsome, but a litte tip of variation for iced cap lovers: Instead of putting the coffee and milk mixture in a glass of ice, blend it in with the ice in a blender, if you have an ice breaker.
