recipeinstructions:
- "Bring water to boil in a pot and cook (rehydrate) the cellophane noodles. Drain into a colander or sieve, and cut up into 2-3 pieces (since the noodles are too long as-is for the salad)."
- "Sprinkle on a little salt on the shrimp and rub in. Wash the shrimp and pat dry with paper towels. (The salt-rub is to remove the fishiness.)"
- "Remove the guts and cartilage from the squid. Cut off the tentacles one by one (cut the long ones in half). Slice the body into rounds."

- "Heat sesame oil in a frying pan, add ground meat and stir fry until crumbly."
- "Add shrimp and squid, sprinkle in salt and pepper, add red chili pepper and stir fry quickly."
- "Add onion and chives and stir fry. When the vegetables have wilted and the shrimp and squid have changed color, it&#39;s done."
- "Combine the cellophane noodles, cucumber, lettuce and stir fried ingredients from Step 7 into a bowl, add the ☆ ingredients and mix well."
- "Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, transfer to serving plates and it&#39;s done! It&#39;s also good if you chill in the refrigerator for a while. It tastes even better the next day when the flavors have melded together."
- "If you add cilantro or celery, or sprinkle chopped peanuts at the end, it will taste even more authentic."
