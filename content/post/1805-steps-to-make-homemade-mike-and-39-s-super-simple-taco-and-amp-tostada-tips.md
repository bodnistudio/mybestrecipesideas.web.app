- "Instead of adding your dry packet seasoning mix into your dry fried ground beef and risk clumping. Or, even adding plain water to moisten and dissolve it. Try using a 1/2 cup + of beef stock for moisture and additional flavor. Mix, steam, simmer and cover."
- "Add a good pinch of ground cumin, a dash of Mexican Oregeno, [crushed] fresh ground black pepper, fresh minced garlic and 2 tbsp dehydrated onions. Cover and simmer. Add additional beef stock if need be. Be sure to use dehydrated onions. Believe it or not, they really do make the beef part of the dish."
- "Chop fresh chilled shreadded cabbage, lettuce with drizzled lime juice, tomatoes, cilantro, Viadailla onions for sweetness, firm black sliced olives, [hidden under tomatoes] jalapeños with radishes and refrigerate. Make sure all vegetables are super firm, crazy snapy fresh and chilled! It does make a huge difference!"
- "For the Stacked Refried Beans. Add a bunch of fresh chopped sweet onions, a 1/2 cup Mexican 3 Cheese, firm tomatoes with no seeds, cilantro leaves, minced garlic, jalapeños, a 1/2 packet of taco seasoning and a dash of your favorite red salsa. Just heat and serve. That&#39;s it folks! Easy peasy! No secrets here! You can sauté your vegetables if you want them soft but we don&#39;t here in New Mexico."
- "Fresh chilled, sliced Avocados drizzled with lime juice for flavor and to keep them from browning."
- "Fresh chilled Sour Cream. Add fresh diced chives to it if you have them on hand. They&#39;re always appreciated!"
- "Fresh homemade guacamole. See my recipe for, Mike&#39;s Fiesta Guacamole, under my profile if you&#39;d like."
- "Homemade habenero sauce. See my recipe for, Mike&#39;s Garlic Habenero Chili Sauce, under my profile if you&#39;d like."

- "Homemade chilled Green Salsa. See my recipe for, Mike&#39;s Very Verde Salsa, if you&#39;d like. Here in New Mexico we usually employ both red and green salsa on everything we eat. In fact, we typically call it, &#34;Goin&#39; Christmas on their asses!&#34;"

- "Fresh shredded Mexican 3 Cheese blend."
- "Red Onion and cilantro leaves. always make for a pretty, colorful, delicious garnish."
- "You can use fresh lime wedges or lime juice. Your choice. Used mostly to keep fresh ingredients from browning as well as for flavor. Either works just as well. It&#39;s up to you!"
- "Sliced sirlon, shreaded chicken and shrimp mixed with your basic Taco seasoning goes great with these as well. Just make sure your proteins are hot and your sides are super crispy and chilly! Enjoy!"
