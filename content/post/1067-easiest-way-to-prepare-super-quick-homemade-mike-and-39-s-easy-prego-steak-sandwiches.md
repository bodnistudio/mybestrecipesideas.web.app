This simple steak sandwich recipe is served all over Portugal - the green piri-piri, although not traditional. These steaks flavored with onions and red wine are called garlic &#34;nailed&#34; steaks because a small meat mallet is typically used to &#34;nail&#34; the garlic slices into the steak. If you like drama, go for it, but I usually just push the garlic in with my finger - it doesn&#39;t really stay in too well anyway. Craving Jersey Mike&#39;s, but can&#39;t decide what to order?
