Place cracker crumbs in another shallow bowl. Dip each pork chop in egg mixture, then coat with cracker crumbs, patting to make a thick coating. The double-dipping of the pork into the egg, then the cheesy crumbs, ensures the coating will stick to the meat. Browning the pork chops in the skillet helps give a headstart to baking in the oven. Heat the oil in a frying pan and brown the chops all over, seasoning as you go.
