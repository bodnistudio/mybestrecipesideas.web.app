Rice cookers have a preset which automatically switches from cook to warm setting once it thinks the rice is done. Since we&#39;re cooking cake instead of rice, we need to trick it into thinking that it&#39;s still cooking rice when making this cake. I put it in the &#34;cake&#34; mode of my rice cooker. Preheat rice cooker by pressing down the &#34;cook&#34; button and it will pop back to warm in a minute or two. Pour the cake batter into the rice cooker.
