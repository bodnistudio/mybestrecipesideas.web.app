<h3>Instructions to make Sausage Pot Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Take the sausages out of the casings and start sautéing them with the onion, garlic and carrots. Don’t overdo the heat, the carrots have to cook somewhat. Add the pepper last so it saves it’s structural integrity. Put that aside..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Make a roux with the flour, butter, milk and as much cheese as you’the like. Season the roux as well. Return the meat and vegetables to the roux and incorporate..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			I made pie crusts this time, but you can use the two store bought pie crust technique. Either way, add the mixture into the pie crust and seal by crimping or using a fork. Cut an air vent and apply an egg wash..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Into the oven at 425F bake 30 mins or until the crust is a beautiful golden brown..
			
			
		</li>
