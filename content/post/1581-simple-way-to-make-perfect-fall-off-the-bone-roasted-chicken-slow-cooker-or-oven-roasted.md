recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and dry the chicken, inside and out well"
- "Spray the crock pot or roasting pan with non stick spray"
- "Once chicken is dry, separate the skin from the breast just enough to get 2 fingers with the butter and garlic mixture between the skin and the meat, place 1/4th of mixture on each breast, pull the skin back down and criss cross together sealing with a toothpick. Tie the legs together.  Flip the chicken over and repeat between the rib meat and skin.  Now, massage the skin with butter or olive oil.

I sometimes add dry Italian dressing seasoning and lemon."
- "Pour half of the broth on the bottom of the crock pot or roasting pan.  Add all your veggies and remaining broth.  This adds a lot of liquid so if you put in crock and plan on not browning the chicken, omit the broth, just SEASON WELL. . Place seasoned chicken breast side down on top of vegies. Yes....breast side down!  This keeps the breast meat really really tender and so so juicy.  For Slow cooker:  Cover and cook 4-6 hours on high or 6-8 hrs on low, until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink. Remember, Not all crock pots cook the same.  Mine takes about 4-5hrs on high, 6 hours on low.  For Oven/Roasting pan: see note below"
- "Optional for gravy. Slow cooker: Remove chicken and vegies to a cookie sheet or roasting pan, broil in a 400째F oven until chicken is browned. If Oven roasted: remove chicken and vegies to serving plate and cover.         Then... Mix 1 tbsp of cornstarch to 2 tbsp of water, mix well and add to crock pot or roasting pan, scraping the yummy bits on the bottom, bring to boil and simmer for 10 minutes,  for gravy. If its to thick slowly add alittle more broth to your desired consistency.  My hubs skips this step when I&#39;m working and just uses the yummy broth so I season the bird really REALLY WELL originally..    No matter how you cook it,  Let chicken rest for 10 minutes before serving."
- "Enjoy!!!!!!"
- "Note:      You can roast in the oven at 375째F covered for 2 hrs instead of using the crock pot. Just baste it every so often and make sure you Cook breast side down, uncover and flip at the 2 1/2 hr mark and roast for 30 minutes uncovered or until breast side is a golden brown. Gives a crispy skin."
