Dried soy &#34;meat&#34; -- known to vegetarians as either TVP, textured vegetable protein, or TSP, textured soy protein -- makes a convenient addition to tofu and tempeh in your meatless repertoire. Unlike its animal counterpart, TVP stores long-term without refrigeration. Simply wrap in foil tightly and store in the fridge until ready to use the next day. I recommend making smaller balls for tacos and larger balls for burritos.
