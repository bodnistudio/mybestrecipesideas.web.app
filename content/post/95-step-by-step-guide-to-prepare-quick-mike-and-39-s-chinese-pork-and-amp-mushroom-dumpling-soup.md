Stir constantly as so your dumplings don&#39;t stick together. Because they will. Also, stir from the bottom as to not break up your dumplings.  You&#39;ll know your dumplings are fully cooked when they float.  Know your soup will thicken up with the addition of your dumplings."

So does the chilled pickled Ginger! Try just one hot dumpling with chilled pickled ginger on it. I swear, it&#39;s a freaking life changer!  Enjoy!"
