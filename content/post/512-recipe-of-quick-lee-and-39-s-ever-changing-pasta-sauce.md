recipeingredient:
- "2 lb ground beef"
- "1/2 lb mild Italian sausage bulk"
- "2 tbsp butter"
- "1 1/2 large onions  any kind you like"
- "1 each green and yellow bell pepper"
- "1 dozen chopped mushrooms"
- "5 clove fresh garlic crushed"
- "2 can crushed tomato"
- "1 can tomato paste"
- "1 can sliced or crushed black olives"
- "1/2 can stuffed green olives halved"
- "2 dash red chili flakes"
- "1 water"
- "2 dash black pepper"
- "2 dash salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Brown the ground beef and sausage in a skillet with the butter, 1/2 onion, 2 cloves of the garlic, small can of black olives (include juice), 1/2 can of stuffed green olives (discard juice) and a dash each of salt, black pepper and chili flakes"
- "Pour the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste into a large sauce pan, add the other three cloves of garlic and dashes each of the salt, pepper and chili flakes."
- "Pour everything in the skillet into the tomato-filled sauce pan and simmer for up to three hours, stirring often and occasionally adding a cup of water so that it doesn&#39;t thicken too much. Thirty minutes before you decide that it&#39;s ready, mutilate the fresh vegetables and add them to the red heaven in the sauce pan."
- "Cook up your favorite pasta, pour sauce over it and enjoy. You might consider using a plate, rather than eating it straight out of the pan like a bachelor."
- "This is a very thick pasta sauce - the only kind that should exist, in my opinion. I&#39;ve made it many times over the years, and each time I make it I change something - this time, I added the green olives (mostly because they were in the fridge and needed to be used before they expired). Believe it or not, this recipe began about twenty years ago, with a jar of sauce, ground beef and an onion all cooked together and then poured over Ramen noodles, but this particular iteration represents my most recent attempt at improvement, and anyone who got any away from me was very pleased with the result."
