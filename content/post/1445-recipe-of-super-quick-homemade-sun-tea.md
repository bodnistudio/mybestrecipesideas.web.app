![Sun Tea](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/4942361357451264/751x532cq70/sun-tea-recipe-main-photo.jpg)

Hello everybody, I hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, sun tea. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Sun Tea is one of the most popular of current trending foods on earth. It is appreciated by millions every day. It is easy, it's quick, it tastes delicious. Sun Tea is something which I've loved my whole life. They are nice and they look fantastic.

Move the container if necessary to keep it in the sun. The nostalgic beverage from childhood that brings back warm memories of sitting out on our back porch sipping tea and spitting watermelon seeds. It seems that all my adolescent summertime memories involve a large glass jug of this amber-colored quencher.


To begin with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have sun tea using 4 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Sun Tea:

1. Take 1 gallon water, filtered
1. Get 8 tea bags
1. Get 2 cup sugar (optional)
1. Prepare 1 lemon, sliced (optional)


It&#39;s the perfect beverage for cooling off by the pool on a hot summer&#39;s day. Use cold filtered water and infuse the tea at room temperature instead of brewing the tea in the sun. Think of this sun tea as the tea-lover&#39;s version of cold brewed coffee. Sun tea is just that: tea brewed in sunlight instead of with pre-boiled water.

##### Instructions to make Sun Tea:

1. Filter 1 gallon of water in a clear glass jar.
1. Place 8 bags of your favorite brand tea into jar.
1. Replace lid loosely and place tea jar in full sun.
1. Allow sun to brew tea 3-5 hours depending on desired strength.
1. Add sugar, if desired. Mix thouroughly.
1. Refridgerate or serve over ice.


While making sun tea feels very homesteady, like baking your own bread or growing herbs, it should only be done safely, and with the right equipment. Grab a large clear glass jar that has a lid. Unlike your classic hot tea that&#39;s brewed for a few short minutes in boiling (or near boiling) water or iced tea that brews briefly then is enjoyed over ice, sun tea is made by brewing tea in a clear container set in the sun for several hours. Caffeinated black tea is most often used as the base. When the sun is beating down and even the thought of boiling water makes you sweat, consider making sun tea.
