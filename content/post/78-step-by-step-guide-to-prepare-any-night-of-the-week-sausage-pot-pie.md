Add the spaghetti sauce, beans and thyme to the sausage in the skillet. Remove from heat and stir in the mozarella cheese. Pour the mixture into a medium size, round oven proof skillet or pie dish. A homemade pot pie bubbling away in the oven for an hour is well and good, but I love this shortcut: make a quick filling in the Instant Pot and a quick pastry in the oven and join them in holy matrimony at the end. Andouille sausage adds tons of smoky flavor, and store-bought puff pastry makes a super flaky topping with very little effort.
