recipeingredient:
- "260 grams Sweet potato about 1 medium size"
- "20 grams Unsalted butter"
- "45 grams Sugar"
- "1 Egg medium"
- "50 grams Milk 40 fat or higher"
- "10 drops Vanilla oil"
- "2 tsp Cointreau optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the sweet potato, cut into small pieces to cook easily. Soak in water to remove the bitterness."
- "Drain and cover with cling film. Microwave until tender and mash."
- "Add the sugar, egg, milk, butter, vanilla oil (or vanilla beans) and Cointreau (optional), and mix until smooth."
- "If you like a smoother texture, you can put the mixture through a sieve. Put the mixture in a piping bag, and pipe into paper cups in a swirling motion."
- "If you pipe the mixture into the sweet potato skin, make sure not to leave air inside."
- "Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes at 220℃, until brown."
- "If you use the sweet potato skin as a container, it will look like a baked potato! Brush egg yolk on the surface before baking. Brush on orange marmalade to finish."
- "If you put sweet azuki bean paste balls in the middle when piping out the mixture, they will have a Japanese taste. They have a nice, dense texture and are delicious."
- "Add chopped orange peel if you like. Adding chopped orange peel makes them more refreshing and they will have a sophisticated taste."
- "If you use the baked &#34;Mitsu imo&#34;, you can make these easily with a little butter and no sugar. They are so delicious!"
