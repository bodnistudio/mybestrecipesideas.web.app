When I walk into a BBQ restaurant, I always order the slaw and judge accordingly. In my humble opinion, bad slaw will kill my review of an otherwise good restaurant. I hate an overly saturated slaw where the cabbage is literally swimming in mayo. Traditional Carolina barbecue was topped with coleslaw long before anyone thought to put tomatoes and lettuce on a burger—before there were burgers, in fact.
