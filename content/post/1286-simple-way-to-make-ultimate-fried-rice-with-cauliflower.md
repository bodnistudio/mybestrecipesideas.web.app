A Cauliflower Fried Rice recipe that looks and tastes so much like normal fried rice, I totally forgot it was made with cauliflower! And even once I was on board, it took me many months before I was happy enough with cauliflower fried rice to share the recipe with you. This &#34;Cauliflower Fried Rice&#34; is EXCELLENT (chef worthy)! I had imagined so many adaptations to the recipe before I had actually made it (i.e. marinate the meat; switch up the pork for a combination of pork, chicken, and shrimp; add hot pepper sauce and/or fresh grated ginger) but I don&#39;t think there is much.
