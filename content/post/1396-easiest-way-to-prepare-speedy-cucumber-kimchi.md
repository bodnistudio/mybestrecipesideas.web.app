recipeinstructions:
- "In a large stainless steel or mixing bowl, toss the cucumbers, green onion and salt together. Make sure to thoroughly incorporate the salt throughout the cucumber. In 20 to 30 minutes, you should start to see the cucumber release water. Let the cucumber sit for about 2 hours, tossing and redistributing every 30 minutes to ensure even brining."

- "Make the paste by putting all the paste ingredients into a blender and blend until you can&#39;t see the individual grains of rice. Pour the paste over the cucumber."
- "Get into the bowl with your hands and mix that paste into the cucumber until all the pieces are evenly and thoroughly coated."
- "Pack your kimchi into a bottle or other tight-lidded container (This time I repurposed a half gallon kimchi jar) and use the last 1/3 cup of water to swish around the mixing bowl, pick up all the remaining paste, and pour that liquid on top of your kimchi. Remember to leave 1 to 2 inches of headspace at the top to allow for expansion as fermentation takes place."
- "Your cucumber kimchi is now ready for fermentation in a dark but not cold place like the inside of your cupboard. Or, if you can find a warmish spot in your garage, you can put it there. (I know that&#39;s not always possible for cold climate people in the middle of winter.)"
- "This is the kimchi after about 3 days of fermentation."
