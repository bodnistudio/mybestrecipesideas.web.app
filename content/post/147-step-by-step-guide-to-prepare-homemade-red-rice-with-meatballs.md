Porcupine balls get their name from the way they look! Rice is added to the meatball mixture, and as it cooks, it sticks out of the meatballs, resembling porcupine quills!. I took out the processed canned tomato soup, but my classic porcupine meatballs recipe still has the delicious taste from my childhood, with a flavorful tomato. You&#39;ll love Hawaiian Meatballs and Rice - ground beef meatballs, with pineapple, red and green bell peppers in sweet and sour sauce, served on a bed of rice. They&#39;re extra soft and juicy, and I really am a sucker for good meatballs.
