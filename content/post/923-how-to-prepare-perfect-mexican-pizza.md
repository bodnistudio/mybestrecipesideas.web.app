recipeinstructions:

- "Par bake the crust for 8 minutes. If it still feels a little under done put it back in for another 5 minutes."
- "Mix the tomato sauce and taco bell mild sauce together spread into an even layer across the whole crust."
- "Cover edge to edge with your favorite taco meat."
- "Cover with the cheddar and mozzarella then bake for 10 minutes."
- "After 10 minutes if the cheese doesn&#39;t have any color move to the top rack and bake for another 2-3 minutes."
- "Cut and cover with you favorite toppings."
