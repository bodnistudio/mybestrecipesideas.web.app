recipeinstructions:

- "Prepare the usuyaki tamago.  Use 6 large eggs to make 14 thin omelets in a 24 cm frying pan."
- "Cut the edges of the omelets into a square.  The excess can be used for tamago &#39;gunkan&#39; (battleship, as shown in the pictures below wrapping around the sushi balls) or thinly sliced omelets for the temari balls."

- "Ex. 5 Cover a portion of sushi rice with one shiso leaf and place 4 pieces of squid in a crisscross pattern on top to make squid shiso leaf temari."
- "Ex. 6 Sprinkle toasted sesame over sushi rice, and place two small pieces of salmon on top to make salmon temari."
- "Ex. 7 Place one piece of greater amberjack (kanpachi) on temari to make kanpachi temari."
- "Ex. 8 Wrap sliced cucumber around sushi rice as a gunkan roll (seen in pictures) and lay a salmon slice crosswise to make salmon cucumber temari."
- "After making temari sushi balls as desired, lay the container with a usuyaki tamago omelet to place the sushi balls on top. When all are in place, cover tightly with plastic wrap and put the lid on."
- "Cover the container with 4 omelets and cut the excess with scissors so they fit in the container. When preparing ahead of time, cover the plastic wrap over the eggs."
- "Lay the sliced cucumbers crosswise, so that the edges are 3-4 cm longer than the container height and drape over the side."
- "For a bow, drain Step 3. Fold one slice twice and secure one folded slice after another crisscross on a toothpick."
- "Once folding is finished, place the folded slices on top so that the toothpick is invisible. Adjust the cucumber slices to make the bow look pretty. Done!"
- "When placing on a table, tuck in the edges of the cucumber slices between the bottom of the container and the table. This helps the bow look like it wraps all around."
- "To eat, remove the cucumber bows and take away the omelet lid with the plastic wrap attached."
