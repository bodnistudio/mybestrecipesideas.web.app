Season both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper. The Moosewood Cook Book has several recipes for fish baked in foil. I decided to take the method and add the veggies and seasonings that sounded good to me. Rub a bit of olive oil on the foil so the fish won&#39;t stick. Place a tilapia fillet in the middle of the foil.
