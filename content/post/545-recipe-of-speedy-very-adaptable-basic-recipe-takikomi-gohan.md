- "Cut up the B. ingredients into easy to eat pieces. Drain off any excess moisture."
- "Put the drained rice from Step 1 and the Step 2 ingredients in the rice cooker, and soak for 30 minutes."
- "The total of the Step 3 ingredients is a bit less than 400 ml, so it&#39;s just the right amount of liquid for 2 rice cooker cups of rice."
- "If you have drained the rice properly in Step 2, the liquid should be enough for the rice cooker &#39;2 cup&#39; line."
- "After Step 4 (soaking for 30 minutes), add the dashi stock granules and mix in. Mix the rice at least once."
- "Add the cut up ingredients from Step 3 to the rice cooker, switch the cooker on and cook as usual."
- "To make the 5-ingredient chicken rice: Cut the chicken into easy to eat pieces and combine with the C. ingredients. Let rest for 30 to 40 minutes."
- "Don&#39;t let the chicken sit for too long or it will become too salty."
- "Grill the chicken over an open flame until lightly singed on the outside. The chicken can still be raw inside, but this open-flame quick grilling adds a lot of flavor. You can skip this step if you prefer, and the rice will still be fine."
- "If you don&#39;t have access to an open flame to grill the chicken, leave as-is but pat the surface dry with paper towels."
- "Attention: If you don&#39;t pat the marinated chicken properly dry, the rice will become too salty."

- "The rice is cooked! Mix it up using a cut-and-fold motion with your rice paddle, leave to rest in the cooker for another 10 minutes, and it&#39;s done."

- "For how to cook the rice in a Staub pot, see Steps 22 onwards."
- "Here I just added burdock root and aburaage, and mixed in some simmered shiitake mushrooms when the rice was cooked. This is delicious."
- "Whatever vegetables, meat, etc. you  add to the rice, this is a very well flavored takikomi gohan, so it&#39;s good for onigiri rice balls. It also goes well with nori seaweed."
- "Simmered shiitake mushrooms, which are also used as an accompaniment to somen or cold udon noodles, are also great with this."
- "To make 2 rice cooker cups of rice in a 20 cm diameter Staub pot, follow the same steps, just cook in the Staub pot instead of a rice cooker."
- "For Step 7 above: start cooking with the Staub over medium heat. When the edges of the liquid start to bubble, adjust the heat so that the flames aren&#39;t peeking out from under the pot."
- "When big bubbles rises to the surface, cover the cocotte with a lid. Set a timer to 1 minute."
- "I added the additional ingredients without flavoring them, since I mix the simmered shiitake mushrooms in later. Otherwise, add them as specified in Steps 14 and 18."
- "After 1 minute has passed, turn the heat down as low as possible. Set the timer to 9 minutes."
- "After 9 minutes, turn the heat off and leave the pot with the lid on for 12 minutes. Do not open the lid until the 12 minutes are up!"
- "After 12 minutes, the rice is done. I added the simmered shiitake mushrooms from step 25 here and folded them into the rice."
