- "1/2 cup milk halfand half OR heavy cream"
- "1 cup cooked chicken minced"

- "Pinch dried Thyme optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "You can successfully make this soup in less than 10 minutes from pantry items and a couple refrigerated stables... Start by melting 3 tablespoons butter over a medium heat. Once melted sprinkle with 1/4 cup flour and whisk until smooth. This is going to be a roux not a gravy, so take it easy with measuring the flour, no heaping or packing here."
- "Once the flour has absorbed the butter add the milk. Whisk, whisk, whisk. Once the roux thickens add the chicken broth, and you guessed it, whisk."
- "Now because everything else we are adding is cooked and just needs to be brought up to temperature turn the heat to medium-low. Add the minced chicken (this can be canned, rotisserie, leftover, white meat, dark meat, chicken you cooked just because you wanted to make soup... Chicken). Then add the chopped mushrooms. I like using the ugly little canned mushrooms for this soup because it keeps soup prep to less than ten minutes. Stir! You thought I was going to say whisk didn&#39;t you...."
- "I dished my little ones first then added Thyme for my bowl. I hope you enjoy!"
