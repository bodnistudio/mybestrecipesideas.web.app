In a medium bowl, combine the butter, herbs, garlic, and cheese and mix until smooth. I did do one thing differently for this Cheesy Garlic Bread than I would for cheese pizza, and that was to bake it at a slightly lower temperature. I wanted my Cheesy Garlic Bread to stay soft and fluffy, so I baked it slightly lower and slower to give the dough time to puff up in the oven. Add the salt and pepper to taste and set aside or keep in the fridge. Cut loaf of bread in half, then each half into half again.
