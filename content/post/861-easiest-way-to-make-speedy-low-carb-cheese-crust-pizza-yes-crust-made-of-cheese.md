recipeingredient:
- " FOR THE CRUST"
- " cooking spray"
- "1 1/2 cups Grated Mozzerella"
- "1 Egg"
- " FOR THE ZA"
- "1-2 tsp Pizza Sauce"
- " CheddarMozzarella Mix"
- " Pepperoni or other toppings of you choosing"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat Oven to 425"
- "Apply cooking spray to your surface... or you parchment paper."
- "Mix the Mozzarella and Egg on the tray. The egg is just for a bit of firmness, you won&#39;t taste it at all. Create a solid, even layer about 6-8 inches by 6-8 inches. This is for a personal sized pizza, of course."
- "Pop that puppy in the oven for 8-12  minutes. The edges of the crust should be brown, almost burnt looking"
- "Take it out. It is best to wait about 2 hours for the crust to cool down and get crispy. However, you can finish it right away, though it may be gooey and messy."
- "Preset the oven to 400 degrees"
- "Add pizza sauce to your liking. Remember, if you&#39;re trying to cut carbs, this is where most of your carbs will come from. I recommend just a thin layer, 1-2 tsp."
- "Add your cheese and toppings. A cheddar/mozz blend is great because it stands out from the crust. Pepperoni goes great with it, as do vegetables like mushrooms."
- "Put it in again for 8-10 minutes"
- "Enjoy!"
