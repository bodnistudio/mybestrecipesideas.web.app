recipeingredient:
- "10 Round mochi if using square mochi use 23"
- "10 pieces Aburaage cut in half if large"
- "3 1/2 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Mirin"
- "3 1/2 tbsp Soy sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "If the toothpick is long, the aburaage may tear, so cut off each end with kitchen scissors. Using a piece of kanpyo to tie the ends would be even better!"
- "Open up the aburaage so that they become pouches. Pour boiling water over to drain the oil, and stuff with the mochi. Secure closed with a tooth pick. (See Hints.)"
- "If the toothpick is long the aburaage bag may tear, so cut off each end with kitchen scissors. Using a piece of kanpyo to tie it up would be even better!"
- "Put the stuffed pouches in a pot, add 500 ml of water and bring to a boil."
- "Just before it comes to a boil, add the sugar and mirin. When it comes to a boil turn the heat down to low, and put in a small lid that sits right on top of the contents of the pan (otoshibuta or drop lid). Simmer for about 15 minutes."
- "Turn the pan as shown in the photo halfway through, and simmer for another 5 minutes. If you let the sugar penetrate slowly, the mochi won&#39;t get hard easily."
- "Take the drop lid out and add the soy sauce. Simmer over low heat for 15 minutes or so. Be careful not to let it burn!! (If there&#39;s too much liquid, reduce slightly)."
- "Done!"
- "If you want the mochi to be even meltier when cool, cut each mochi in 4 pieces, use 8 pieces of aburaage, and the same amount of flavoring ingredients."

Though I tried my darnedest to get my money&#39;s worth. mochi (n) a Japanese rice cake made of glutinous flour pounded into a paste and molded into shape (source: Wikipedia). I&#39;ve always had a weakness for the chewy texture of rice cakes. It doesn&#39;t really matter what form these rice cakes take. I&#39;m just as happy chewing on savory stir-fried Chinese rice cakes (chao nian gao) as I am snacking on sweet Japanese mochi. Sushi comes in many forms, whether it&#39;s rolled-up maki, bite-sized nigiri, box-shaped oshizushi, or artfully arranged over a bed of rice for chirashizushiâ€¦ but one of the most simple and easily overlooked type has to be the humble inari zushi!.
