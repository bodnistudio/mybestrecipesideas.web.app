Recipe Pin It While Japan may be famous for sushi, home cooking draws from a broad palette of global flavors. Try out this Japanese potato salad, and we promise that you will not be disappointed. Unlike the potato salads we know and love in the UK, Japanese potato salad contains other exciting vegetables and proteins (ham, egg, cucumber, carrot), as well as an umami-rich dressing full of Japanese seasonings (the most prominent of which being kewpie mayonnaise). Getting potato salad right is no picnic. Too often it lacks the acidity or piquancy needed to cut through the richness of the mayonnaise.
