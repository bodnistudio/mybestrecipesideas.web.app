recipeinstructions:
- "Using cold water, wash potatoes but do not puncture them whatsoever. Place clean spuds in enough cold water to cover the potatoes by 1&#34;+ of water and add salt. Bring water to a boil with a tight fitting lid and boil spuds for 13 - 15 minutes. Check at 13 minutes.                                                                                         Unlike potatoes that you&#39;d boil for mashed spuds dishes, you&#39;ll notice these spuds are floating. It&#39;s the large amount of salt added causing that reaction. You&#39;ll also notice that your stove top is completely flecked with millions of tiny white dots. It&#39;s the salt as well and cleans up easily."
- "Begin making your butter sauce by adding everything in that specific category and placing on low flame and slowly simmering."
- "Check one potato at 13 minutes for tenderness. You&#39;ll want these as soft and creamy as a baked spud in the center but NOT soggy. Discard that pierced potato, otherwise, it&#39;ll absorb all of the salt in the water and will be inedible."
- "Drain spuds momentarily in sink and allow to quickly dry. Almost instantly their skins will morph into a dried, white, salted coating. Place those hot spuds evenly in serving bowls."
- "Equally pour butter sauce into 4 small Ramekin bowls. Here&#39;s a tip though: A LITTLE BUTTER SAUCE GOES A VERY LONG WAY! So, don&#39;t worry about adding smaller amounts to your Ramekin dishes. :0) Then, lightly drizzle your remaining butter sauce over your plated potatoes. Following that step, garnish your spuds with a light dusting of onion powder, course sea salt, fresh chives, fresh parsley if you have it &amp; grated parmesean cheese. Offer a few toothpicks at serving and always offer an optional side dish of sour cream garnished with chives."
- "Serve with an ice cold Guiness Beer that&#39;s sat properly for at least 2 minutes once poured, before serving it in an ice cold mug as well! This is Irish pub food at its finest and most basic folks! Enjoy!"
