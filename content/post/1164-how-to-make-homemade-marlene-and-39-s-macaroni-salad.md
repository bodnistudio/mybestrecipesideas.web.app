As I&#39;ve gotten older, my aversion to mayo has not only disappeared, but has in fact spun on it head.… Cook macaroni according to package directions; drain and rinse with cold water. For dressing, in a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, pickle relish, sugar substitute, mustard, salt and pepper. In a large bowl, combine the macaroni, celery, carrot and onion. Add dressing and toss gently to coat. Peas straight from the freezer retain their crisp exterior and soft, creamy interior in this simple-to-make salad.
