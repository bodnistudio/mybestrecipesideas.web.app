For me, this no-bake ice cream sandwich cake recipe is pure nostalgia â€” but it&#39;s also the easiest way to make an ice cream cake at home. Scoop the strawberry ice cream onto the sandwiches, then spread evenly with a spatula until the sandwich layer is covered. Remove the cake from the freezer, then carefully remove the cake from the dish and peel off any foil that has stuck to the bottom and sides. And covered the top with the rest of the whipped cream.
