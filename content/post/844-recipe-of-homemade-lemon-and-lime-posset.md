recipeingredient:
- "600 ml double cream"
- "150 g golden caster sugar"
- "2 limes"
- "1 lemon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Adding zest is optional. They probably look better without the zest but I like the taste. So the first step is to zest the limes and lemon but leave it out if you don&#39;t want zest in yours."
- "Squeeze the limes and then the lemon until you have 75ml of juice. The limes will make around 50 - 60ml. You&#39;ll want all of the lime juice and then just add lemon juice to make up to 75ml, I use the remaining lemon juice in a drink once I&#39;m finished to celebrate my pudding triumph!"
- "Set aside the juice and zest and get some ramekins and a jug ready. It&#39;ll make 6 - 7 ramekins but you could use glasses or any solid container really."
- "Add the sugar and cream to a saucepan and bring to the boil while stirring the whole time. Once boiling, reduce the heat right down (careful because its very easy to let it boil over). Stir in the juice and zest."
- "Once completely mixed, pour the mixture in to a jug to make it easier to pour between the ramekins or glasses."
- "Pour in to the final pots and then leave at room temperature to cool down before putting in the fridge."
- "They can take around 3 hours to set and last a few days in the fridge uncovered."
