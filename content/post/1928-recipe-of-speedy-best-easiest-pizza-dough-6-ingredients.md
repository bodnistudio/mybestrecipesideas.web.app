Warm water: There are no eggs or milk in pizza dough, just water!; Yeast: I tested both instant (rapid rise) and active dry yeast here. Instant yeast gave the best results, but active dry yeast does a decent job if that&#39;s all you have (it just may need a little more time to rise). Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into four pieces, for medium-crust pizza; or three pieces, for thicker crusts. Let the dough rest several times to relax it and make it more cooperative. Create your own pizza base and top it with your favourite ingredients.
