The bhatura recipe is a little different than the standard poori (puri) recipe in that the dough is made with a leavening agent like yeast or baking soda. Choley bhature is a lip-smacking and spicy recipe that is prevalent in the northern parts of India. A combination of choley (chick peas) and bhature (fried breads that resemble poori), the dish is a typical Punjabi food, which is usually eaten as a breakfast or lunch, accompanied with lassi. Chole Bhature is a combination of chana masala (spicy white chickpeas) and bhatura, a fried bread made from maida flour.
