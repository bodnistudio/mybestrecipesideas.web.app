One thing I absolutely adore about this recipe is that it serves as a fantastic meal prep meal and freezer meal. The lentils and rice recipe is made so fast you can make it in the morning before going to work, add it to one of those amazing thermos containers and enjoy your hot lunch a couple hours later.

Find a nice low simmer, cover the pot, and let it be.
