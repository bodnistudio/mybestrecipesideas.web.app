The rice and the chicken both turned out to be overcooked and the rice lacked taste in general. If I make this recipe again I would add chicken broth to the water to cook the rice in and maybe add some veggies to the rice as well. Chicken and rice casseroles are a staple of American cooking. This version uses cream of mushroom, cream of celery, and cream of chicken to give a rich flavor to a quick school-night dinner when getting your back-to-school routine settled. Chicken bog is a South Carolina tradition with lots of variations (think herbs, spices and fresh veggies), but the standard ingredients remain: sausage, chicken and rice.
