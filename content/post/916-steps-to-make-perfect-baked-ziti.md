Hey everyone, it's Jim, welcome to our recipe site. Today, we're going to make a special dish, baked ziti. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Baked Ziti is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It's easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It's enjoyed by millions daily. They are nice and they look fantastic. Baked Ziti is something which I have loved my entire life.

Try RICOTTA CHEESE instead of sour cream and skip the provolone for a real Italian version of Baked Ziti. Mix an egg into a pound of ricotta to make it nice and creamy, and toss with the ziti. Layer sauce first (so you don&#39;t need to butter the pan), then ziti/cheese, mozzarella, sprinkle with parm and a little dried oregano or basil, then.


To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook baked ziti using 11 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

Baked Ziti is a classic baked pasta dish. It&#39;s basically some kind of tomato or meat sauce baked in a dish with some kind of cheese and, of course, ziti noodles—unless you&#39;re me, then you use mostaciolli noodles. Some people just use tomato/marinara sauce. That, of course, would never fly in this house.

Our baked ziti recipe is a dish all cooks should have in their repertoire. Baked macaroni dishes like ziti combine cooked pasta with a sauce, vegetable, and/or meat -- and plenty of cheese. Baked ziti can become dry for several reasons. When assembling the dish, be sure to cover the pasta with enough of the sauce so that the noodles don&#39;t dry out. Also, to prevent moisture from evaporating while cooking, cover the dish tightly with foil.
