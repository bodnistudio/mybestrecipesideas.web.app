One would think that one could merely pour brewed coffee into a glass full of ice and call it a dayâ€¦but I find that method extremely flawed. First, no matter how packed with ice the glass is, once the hot coffee hits, some of the ice is bound to melt. Making delicious iced coffee at home is a cinch. Best of all, the secret to the best coffee is to eliminate heat from the process altogether.

Cold-processed coffee is less bitter, and it allows. Making iced coffee takes only a minute when you brew the coffee ahead of time. Just pour the morning&#39;s leftovers into a pitcher and keep it in the fridge. Pour the coffee into a clean ice cube tray and freeze. Coffee ice cubes are the perfect way to prevent your iced coffee from losing its kick: when the cubes melt, they&#39;ll be adding more coffee, rather than water, to your coffee drink.
