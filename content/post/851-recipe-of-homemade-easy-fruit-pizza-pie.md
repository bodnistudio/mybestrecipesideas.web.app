		I have always loved fruit pizza, but in the past, it seemed to be a bit of a tedious recipe to make because I had to. a) make the cookie dough. b) make a fluffy white topping. c) cut up the fruit and carefully arrange it on the pizza Used the pre-made cookie dough from the local bakery on full cookie sheet.
	
		Doubled the recipe worked great for that size.
	
		Used mango kiwi grapes blueberries strawberries plums and nectarines.
