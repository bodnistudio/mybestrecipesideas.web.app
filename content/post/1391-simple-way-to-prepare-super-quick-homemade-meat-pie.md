<h3>Steps to make Meat Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Brown ground beef in a heated saute pan and season with season all- about 2 minutes.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees Farenheit (or as directed on pre-made crusts).
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add onion and garlic, and continue cooking until beef becomes more done and onion is almost clear.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add mushrooms and continue cooking for about 1-2 minutes, careful not to over cook the mushrooms, then drain meat..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Return beef mixture to pan and mix in the mushroom soup, heat through until it starts to boil, stirring occasionally.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Turn off heat, and prep your pie dish with the bottom crust. Pour in beef mixture and spread it around the dish evenlly..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Carefully place the second crust on top of the mixture. Tear off extra pie pastry from the edges and pinch them together into your favorite crust design. ( I do the classic thumb press between two fingers..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Make a few slits in the top crust to allow it to vent. Then carefully wrap the crust you just pinch together with aluminum. This will keep it from burning since the crust cooks faster than the rest of the pie..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place pie in oven middle rack, and let cook for approx. 15 minutes or until middle of pie begins to brown..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Carefully take off aluminum from the crust and continue backing for 15-20 minutes or until crust is well browned as desired..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Take out the pie and let cool for 5 min, then serve!.
			
			
		</li>
