recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl,whisk the egg with the crushed garlic. Add the pieces of cubed steak, which have been cut in to desired portions. I like 2 smaller pieces per person, as opposed to 1 larger piece. Coat both sides of the meat with the egg wash. Make sure that the garlic gets evenly distributed. Let soak for 5-10 minutes."
- "While the meat is absorbing the egg wash, mix the breadcrumbs, flour, salt, and pepper(s) in a separate bowl."
- "Dip the egg washed meat, one piece at a time, in the seasoned flour/breadcrumb mixture. Coat both sides of meat. Place on a tray that is lined with waxed paper. Repeat, until all the pieces are well coated with the breading. Dump any excess breading on top of all the pieces of meat on the tray. Turn meat to coat with some of the extra breading."
- "In a large frying pan, heat the oil over med/hi heat until a smoking point is almost reached. The oil should be hot."
- "Fry the steaks for 8-9 minutes, turning a few times. Fry in 2 batches, if your pan is not big enough to fry all the meat at once. Keep cooked steaks warmed on a platter in a 225°F oven, while you prepare the gravy."
- "For the gravy, use the same pan that you fried the steaks in, reserving 3 1/2 Tbsp of the oil/drippings. Add the flour and whisk over med/hi heat until lightly browned. Add the milk and stir constantly until a full boil is reached. Reduce the heat and add seasonings, Stir well and cook a couple more minutes until well thickened."
- "Serve steaks with mashed or boiled potatoes, spooning some gravy on top. Add your favorite vegetable on the side. I prefer broccoli with this."
