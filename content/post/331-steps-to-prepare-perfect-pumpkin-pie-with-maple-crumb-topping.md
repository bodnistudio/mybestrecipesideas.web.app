- "To make the topping while th pie is baking, combine flour, sugar, butter and ginger in a food processor."
- "Pluse until it becomes crumbly but do not over process as it will turn to dough."
- "Carefully add the topping to the pie and bake for another 30-40 minutes, until the crumb topping is golden brown."
