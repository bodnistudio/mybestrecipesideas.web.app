	<strong>Chocolate pecan pie</strong>. 
	I kind of disobeyed the directions and I layered the chocolate and then pecans instead of stirring it all together. I put the chocolate on the crust and then put tons of pecans over it (I think pecan pies never have enough pecans) and then I poured the sugar-y mixture over the top - of course I had extra sugar mixture because I added too many pecans but it was well worth it. We can thank the South for bringing pecan pie into the mix of America&#39;s favorite Thanksgiving desserts.
