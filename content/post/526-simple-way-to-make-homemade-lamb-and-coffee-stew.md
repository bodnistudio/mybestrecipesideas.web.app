The idea for coffee came from the classic southern &#34;red eye gravy&#34;, and later still I learned that using coffee as a flavor deepener is a typical French technique. This all is even more surprising since I do not usually cook in the French tradition. The lamb was perfectly cooked with a golden crust and it was a nice medium rare in the middle. The coffee sauce went really well with the lamb and the mustardy crust on the lamb was nice and tasty.
