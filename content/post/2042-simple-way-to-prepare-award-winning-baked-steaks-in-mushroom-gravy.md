recipeingredient:
- "6 cubed steaks or thin beef steaks tenderized with meat hammer"
- "1-2 cups Flour for dusting or as needed"
- " Vegetable or Canola Oil for frying have at least 12 cup"
- "1 pack fresh mushrooms sliced"
- "1/2 cup allpurpose flour for the gravy"
- "to taste Salt  pepper"
- "4-6 cups water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pour out some white or wheat flour in a dish and flour each cubed steak."
- "In a large frying pan, add enough oil to fill up to about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm). Heat oil and fry steaks until brown on one side..."
- "Then flip and brown on the other side."
- "Remove steaks from oil (do not discard oil!) and place in an oven-safe dish or crock pot/slow cooker. If you&#39;ll be cooking them on the stove top, set aside on a plate for now."
- "Drain most of the oil from the frying pan into a separate cup or bowl, but leave enough to saute mushrooms. Saute mushrooms for a few minutes until they are softened."
- "Transfer mushrooms from frying pan into the oven dish or crock pot (set aside with steaks if cooking on stove top)"
- "Pour in enough of the oil left over from cooking so you have about 1/8 inch (3 mm)"
- "Add 5-6 Tbsp white flour to pan, along with a few sprinkles of salt and pepper."
- "Whisk in and cook on medium until it starts to slightly brown."
- "Add 4 cups water and bring to a full boil. It should start to thicken a little but it&#39;ll still be runny. My mom ended up adding another 1-2 cups after that for a total of 5-6 cups. Let simmer for around 5-10 minutes."
- "Pour the gravy into the slow-cooker/crock pot or your oven dish.  If using the stove-top, just add the steaks and mushrooms back into the gravy."
- "FOR CROCK-POT/SLOW COOKER: Cover with lid and cook on high for 2-3 hours."
- "FOR OVEN: Preheat to 350째F/180째C. Cover oven dish with lid (or foil) and bake for about 2 hours (could be a little more or less,so check for tenderness periodically!)"
- "FOR STOVE TOP: Simmer on low until steaks are tender. Keep an eye on it after an hour or so, to make sure that not too much of the water evaporates and that they don&#39;t get tough."
- "We cooked it in a slow cooker for about 3 hours, and this is what it looks like! Taste the gravy and add more salt and pepper if needed."
- "This dish never goes without serving with mashed potatoes! Pour some mushroom gravy over both the potatoes and the steak, serve and enjoy!"
