- "1 cup soy sauce"
- "1 cup brown sugar"
- "2/3 cup ketchup"
- "1/2 cup chicken broth"

recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all ingredients inside a large mixing bowl except for the chicken."
- "Once all the ingredients are blended, remove about a 1/2 cup and set aside."
- "Now, add the chicken to the mixing bowl."
- "This is best if you allow it to sit and marinate overnight, but I tend to hate waiting. Soooo if you can wait 10 minutes, you&#39;re fine."
- "Heat up the grill and grill away. You can use the marinade inside the mixing bowl to baste the chicken as you cook. Just make sure the marinade is absorbed and chicken is fully cooked before removing and eating."
- "If you do not have an outside grill, that is ok. I made this on a cast iron grill skillet on medium high and a foreman grill, it still came out great. Do not use oil when cooking the chicken. The marinade is all you need."
- "Once the chicken becomes somewhat sticky and brown like the photo and the chicken is fully cooked, it&#39;s time to enjoy."
- "I served this over steamed cabbage and drizzled the reserved marinade from step 2."
