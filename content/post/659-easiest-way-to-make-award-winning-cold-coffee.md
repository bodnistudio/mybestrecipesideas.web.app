Pour the room temperature or chilled coffee into the glass. Leave room for cream and sugar if you take it that way. Add any additional ingredients you like in your coffee (simple syrup is a great way to sweeten up iced coffee), and stir. I prefer SilkÂ® Coconut Milk Beverage and I like to sweeten it with stevia.&#34; Brewing your cold brew coffee in a French press makes the process easier, as it comes with a built-in plunger to filter the coffee once it&#39;s finished brewing. If you don&#39;t have a French press, use a large cup or mason jar, straining the coffee with a coffee filter or a sieve.
