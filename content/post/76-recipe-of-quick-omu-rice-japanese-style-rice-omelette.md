recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the oil in the pan and sauté chicken and vegetables on medium heat. Season with ketchup, a pinch of salt and black pepper BEFORE adding the steamed rice. This is a tip to season evenly. Then add the rice and mix well."
- "Beat eggs with milk and a pinch of salt. Set another pan (I normally use 8&#39;) and heat the oil. Then spread the half of beaten egg. When the egg comes half cooked, put one small bowl of cooked rice."
- "Slide it to the opposite side of the handle, and fold far side toward yourself using chopsticks or turner. Then fold front side to cover the half of the rice like the photo. If you can make omelette nocking the handle, it&#39;s of course the best way to rap the rice beautifully into the egg!"
- "It requires a small technique to shift the omurice to a plate. You can do as you like and find your way, but as for me, I set a plate just under the edge of the pan where the omurice is, and move the pan like to cover the plate.　　Make the shape wth kitchen cloth or paper if necessary. Enjoy with ketchup or tomato sauce or demi-glace sauce."
