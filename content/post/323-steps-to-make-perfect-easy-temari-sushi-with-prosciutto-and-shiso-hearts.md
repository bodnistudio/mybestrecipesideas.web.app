- "5 leaves Shiso leaves"
- "1 to 2 drops for each Lemon juice optional"

- "I folded the crab sticks in half and made slits on the ends. I used them to decorate the dish with daikon radish sprouts in this picture. Sprinkle with lemon juice to your liking."
- "You don&#39;t have to use top-quality prosciutto. I used a slightly cheaper one, like in the picture."
