		Place the pie on a parchment-lined baking sheet (to catch any drips), and put the pie and baking sheet onto the lowest rack of your oven.

		Watch the video above to see how I work through each of the following steps.
	
		Roll out the chilled pie dough: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the disks of chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator).
	
		Putting the pie that is ready for the oven on a hot cookie sheet helps liquefy the solid layers of fat in the pastry so the dough will become impermeable to the liquid in the pie filling.

<h3>Instructions to make Vegetable pie before baking:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			First cut vegetables in cubes and boil in water... Half boil ony put little salt.and strain in and keep aside. In a pan put butter and maida in a low flame add milk and stir it continually, if it become thick Â add egg mix it, add pepper also, in this white sauce add vegetables..in a pie dish pour it.decorste with the item which I mentioned. Preheat the oven in 180 Â degree for half an hour... Bake the upper part also.... It&#39;s ready ðŸ˜Š.
			
			
		</li>
	
</ol>

<p>
	
		Remove the cookie sheet from the oven (don&#39;t forget an oven mittâ€”it will be very hot!) and set the pie on it.
	
		Given that oven space is always at a premium on Thanksgiving, you&#39;ll need to plan your pie baking strategy ahead.
	
		Especially if you&#39;re doing the turkey, too, my suggestion is to bake the pie early in the day, before the turkey goes in.
	
		Cold butter is the key to a flaky pie crust (trust us), and it&#39;s probably a bit too warm after you&#39;ve rolled out the dough.
	
		For that reason, I don&#39;t like to egg-wash frozen-fruit pies, as that extra time in the oven can lead to excessive browning, even with a foil shield.
