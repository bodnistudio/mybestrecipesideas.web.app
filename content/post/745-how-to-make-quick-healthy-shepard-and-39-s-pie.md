<h3>Steps to make Healthy Shepard&#39;s Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Heat coconut oil in a large pot on medium.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add turkey, and stir constantly until fully cooked.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add cumin, ground flax seed, hemp seed, peppers, celery, mushrooms and basil. Stir often and cook until softened, about 5 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In another pot, boil the water and cook your carrots, peas, and broccoli..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Using a slotted spoon, remove vegetables from the water, saving the water, and add to the turkey mixture. Stir well, and transfer into a glass casserole dish..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Using the leftover water, bring back to a boil and add sweet potato. This will give it lots of flavour. Cook until pieces are fully cooked. Drain any remaining water, and mash with salt and pepper..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add mashed sweet potato on top of mixture, spread evenly, cover with tin foil, and bake in the oven at 400 for about 15 minutes. I like the potatoes to dry out a little like a crust, but for softer potatoes reduce time..
			
			
		</li>
	
</ol>

<p>
	
		Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil.
