		This French Silk Pie is incredibly rich and chocolatey, but also light and fluffy.
	
		If you prefer, you can opt for a milder chocolate flavor by omitting the cocoa powder.
	
		For a less sweet pie, opt for solid dark chocolate.
	
		Add in a teaspoon of mint extract in place of the vanilla for a minty twist.
	
		Many French silk pie recipes call for raw eggs to make the mousse-like, silky chocolate filling, but this recipe calls for pasteurized eggs instead, eliminating any food safety worries or concerns.
