Octopus has and still is quite easily found off Maltese shores, and the other typically Mediterranean ingredients - onions, garlic, tomatoes, olives, capers and wine - make this a truly native dish. Put the octopus in a pot with the wine and enough cold water to cover. This is the &#39;easy&#39; version of the classic Greek dish macaronatha, which is octopus meat in a delicious tomato-based sauce over macaroni, topped with grated sheep&#39;s milk cheese. Squid is easier to obtain, and is usually sold already cleaned, thus the ease.
