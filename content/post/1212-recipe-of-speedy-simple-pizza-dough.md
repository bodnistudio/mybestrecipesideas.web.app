recipeinstructions:

- "When the toppings are prepared, remove the dough from the bag and lightly dust with flour. Gently deflate and spread out into any shape you choose. Place on the toppings."
- "If you are using a lot of toppings, or you are making a thick crust, bake the dough by itself for a short time. This will prevent the crust from only getting half baked."

- "Whole wheat pizza:. I recommend this for those who are worried about their blood sugar."
- "You can also make focaccia with this dough. Make dents in the dough with your finger and cover with olive oil. Sprinkle with cheese and herbs and then just bake it. It&#39;s also great with tomatoes."
- "If you spread the dough out thinly and then cook it in a frying pan, you get Naan bread. Cover with a lid and carefully fry on low heat to make Naan. If using a Teflon nonstick pan, you don&#39;t need to use oil!"
- "Divide the dough into 10~12 portions and form into half-moons. Insert fillings and cheese and lightly bake for a bread that children will enjoy eating. 15 minutes at 200°C."
