A pleasantly spiced homemade sausage mixture is easy to make up with a pound or two of ground pork shoulder, not too lean. They are usually made with all-butter puff pastry (often frozen store-bought, a good option); these are wrapped in a very flaky lard and butter pastry. Place on prepared jellyroll pan seam-side down. Repeat with remaining sausage and puff pastry sheet. Brush each sausage roll with the eggwash glaze.
