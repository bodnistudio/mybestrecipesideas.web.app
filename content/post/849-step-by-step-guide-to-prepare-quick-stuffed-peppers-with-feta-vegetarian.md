recipeingredient:
- "2 bell peppers"
- "110 g meat free mince"
- "50 g reduced fat feta cheese"
- "1/2 a medium red onion sliced finely"
- "1 medium tomato chopped"
- "1/2 a red chilli seeds removed and sliced finely"
- "1/4 tsp smoked paprika"
- "1 tiny pinch of ground cumin"
- "1/4 tsp dried oregano"
- "1 tsp olive oil"
- " Spray cooking oil for frying"
- " Salt and pepper to season"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the bell peppers by slicing off the top to form a lid, then scraping out the pith and seeds from the centre. Ensure that the peppers are able to stand up straight if set upon a flat surface. You may need to carefully shave off a tiny bit from the base in order to level them out so they stand freely."
- "Line a baking tray with foil and preheat the oven to 180 (fan)."
- "Heat up a medium-large saucepan over a medium heat and spray in some cooking oil to cover the base liberally. Once hot add the red onions and fry for a couple of minutes. Next add in the tomato and chillies. Stir and fry for a further two minutes. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Add the meat free mince. Combine the ingredients together. Season with the ground cumin, smoked paprika and oregano. Stir once more."
- "Remove from the heat and add 2/3rds of the feta cheese. Stir together and then add 2 tbsp water. This will add some needed moisture to the mixture, as meat free mince doesn&#39;t release any fat when fried."
- "Stuff the peppers with the mixture. Place standing upright into the lined baking tray then add the lids (pepper tops), drizzle over the olive oil and season with some salt. Bake in the oven on a centre shelf at 180 for around 20-25 minutes."
- "Once the peppers are tender and slightly browned on top and the sides, remove from the oven. Leave to cool for a minute. Remove the lids and crumble over the remaining feta, season with pepper. Serve and enjoy! :)"
