- "To make the crust: In a medium bowl, place flour, sugar, salt, and butter. Rub the butter into the dry mixture with our fingers until it resembles a coarse meal. Alternatively, we can use a fork or pastry blender."
- "Add the yolk and mix until it comes together and forms a ball."
- "Transfer onto a cling wrap. Cover and chill it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes."
- "To make custard filling: In a small bowl, stir sugar with hot water until completely dissolved. Set it aside to cool."
- "In a medium pouring jar, whisk the milk, egg, and vanilla extract until thoroughly mixed. Add the sugar syrup and whisk again to combine."
- "To get a smooth custard, strain the mixture twice. First into another bowl, then back into the pouring jar."
- "Assembly: On a lightly floured surface, roll the chilled dough into a thickness of 3/4-inch (0.5 cm)."
- "Using the same size cookie cutter as the tart mold, cut as many circles as possible from the dough. I used 2Â¾-inches (7 cm) tart mold and cookie cutter."
- "Gently press each cut-out into the tart molds."
- "Prick the bottom of each tart shell with a fork for about 10 times. These holes will allow steam to release from the dough while baking and prevent it from puffing up."
- "Pour the custard filling into the tart shell. Fill each up to 75%."
- "Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of custard can stand on its own. If the custard filling cooks too quickly and bubbles up, open the oven door a little for about 10 seconds."
- "Remove tartlets from the shells once cool. Enjoy!"
