- "Place all of the separate ingredients in their own bowls on the table. Don&#39;t forget the shredded cheese!"
- "Make the burritos you will be eating that night first. These are allowed to include tomatos and sour cream on the inside of the burritos. However do not put those inside ones meant for freezing because they will not thaw well..."
- "Start wrapping each burrito. First add rice, then some meat, then cheese, and then the refried beans to the tortillas. Wrap em up, and then wrap the burrito tightly in serrand wrap."
- "Now put 4-6 burritos in each freezer bag."
- "Put them in the freezer and eat them whenever you want with a dollup of sour cream on top."
