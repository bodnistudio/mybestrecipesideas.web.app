The only tricky part, which really isn&#39;t so difficult, is to cook the eggs, vegetables and rice separately, and combine them all at the end. There&#39;s something about the combination of warm rice, cooked egg, a toasty soy-sesame seasoning, and little bits of vegetables (and maybe meat) that&#39;s comforting and utterly delicious. Fried rice is an all-time favorite when it comes to Chinese take-out, but it&#39;s also incredibly easy to cook up yourself at home. Followed directions but added suggestions of other reviewers: more of each of these--ginger minced garlic and low sodium soy sauce.

Simply brown the meat in the pan, set aside then toss back in with the rice and veggies once they&#39;ve finished cooking. Cauliflower Fried Rice: In place of the rice try adding riced cauliflower for a healthy gluten free twist. For the best results, use Chinese-style medium-grain rice, jasmine rice, or sushi rice.
