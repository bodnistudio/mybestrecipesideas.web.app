Last year we tackled a sizzlin&#39; steak fajita (my husband&#39;s favorite), but today we&#39;re giving all the hints for Mexican street tacos, steak style! This is a far cry from simple homemade taco seasoning (although that is delicious with ground beef). On weekend getaways from San Diego to the beaches in Ensenada and Rosarito (Baja California), I found my favorite meal in the delicious soft skirt steak tacos sold by the taqueria street vendors. This recipe tastes exactly how I remember them - without having to make the trip across the border. Marinate the steak for a few hours.
