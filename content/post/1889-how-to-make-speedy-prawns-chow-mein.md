For the best and most authentic homemade Chow Mein like Chinese restaurants or takeouts, I recommend thin, fresh egg noodles. Chow mein is always my love because of its simplicity and yummy. But this version is a little bit time-consuming since I use fresh shrimp and then peel the shell by hand. You can use frozen prawn to save the time. If you not love roasted peanuts, you can skip it.
