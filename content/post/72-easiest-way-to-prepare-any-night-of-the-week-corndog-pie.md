			While stirring, add in the cornmeal. Continue cooking until the mixture develops some thickness and body. Maybe 8-10 mins. Add to your pan (I used a spring form) and top with the remaining cheese..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pop it into a 350F oven for roughly 30 mins. Cheese should be melted and browned. Allow to cool before removing from pan. I suggest parchment paper if using an 8x8 pan..
