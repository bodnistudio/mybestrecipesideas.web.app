recipeinstructions:
- "Put the cream, half the sugar, vanilla essence and Cointreau in a bowl. Beat until it forms thick ribbons."

- "Microwave the mug for another 30 seconds at 600 W and mix quickly again. The caramel will melt completely!"
- "When the caramel cream has cooled down completely so that it falls very slowly from a spoon, drizzle half of it into the completely frozen and set ice cream."
- "In order not to lose the ribbons in Step 7, turn the ice cream over with a spoon a little at a time, and add more caramel. Freeze until set firmly."
- "Roast the walnuts in an oven preheated 180°C for 5 minutes. Cool and crush them, and use as a topping on the ice cream!"
