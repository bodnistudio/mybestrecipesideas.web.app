Smaller pasta might have helped but I did use diced ham that was prepackaged and perhaps real left over ham would have helped with flavor. I also used freshly steamed peas and carrots. It&#39;s also easy to make, even on a busy weeknight. Once the water starts to boil, add the pasta and cook at a rolling boil, uncovered, until al dente, cooked through, but still a little firm to the bite (the low end of the cooking times given on the package). Cook pasta according to package directions; drain.
