Two words for you: pitcher drinks. These cocktails are full of fresh flavors and ingredients, but they can be made in big batches, refrigerated, and pulled out right when the first guests arrive. To make an old-fashioned game like bobbing for apples even more of a spectacle, add an applelicious cocktail to the party. The candy appley cocktail spikes sparkling cider with caramel-flavored moonshine then tosses an apple liqueur and cranberry juice into the mix. It&#39;s not what you&#39;d expect from moonshine and that&#39;s definitely a good thing.
