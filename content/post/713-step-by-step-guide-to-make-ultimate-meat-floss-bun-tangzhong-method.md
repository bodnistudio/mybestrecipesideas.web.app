- "Tangzhong: with a wooden spoon, mix flour, water, and milk in a pan until there is no lump. Cook over medium-low heat and keep stirring to prevent sticking and burning. Remove from heat when the mixture gets thicker (some lines will show as we stir). Set aside to cool."
- "Bread dough: In a stand-mixer&#39;s bowl, combine all dry ingredients. Add milk, egg, and room temperature tangzhong. Mix everything until combined with a dough hook attachment. Scrape the sides and bottoms of bowl with a silicone spatula as needed."
- "When it starts to become a dough, add cubed butter in. The dough will become moist and sticky. So gradually add more flour until the dough feels less sticky to the touch. Mix for about 8 minutes or so. The finished dough should be smooth, elastic, and not sticky."
- "Round up the dough and place in an oil-greased and large bowl. Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Let sit for 1 hour or until doubled in size."
- "After the dough is doubled in size, punch it down to release the gas inside. Transfer onto work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces."
- "Roll each into a ball and place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Cover and let rise until doubled in size."
- "Brush each with an egg wash (lightly beaten egg). Bake in a preheated oven at 350째F (180째C) for 18-20 minutes. Then set aside on a cooling rack."
- "Filling: Stir everything until combined except the meat floss."
- "Version 1: Slice the bun to make a hamburger. Spread the filling on the inside. Put enough meat floss on the bottom half of bun. Then cover with the top half and enjoy."
- "Version 2: Brush the filling onto the bun. Put enough meat floss to cover the top, then enjoy. I prefer to assemble them right before serving as the filling needs to be chilled in the fridge if not eaten on the same day."
