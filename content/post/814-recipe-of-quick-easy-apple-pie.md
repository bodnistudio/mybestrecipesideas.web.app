<h3>Steps to make Easy Apple Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Defrost the frozen puff pastry. Preheat the oven to 200°C. Peel the apple, cut into 8 pieces, and take out the core. Slice into 5 mm pieces. Put the ○ ingredients in a bowl and mix well..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cover one puff pastry evenly with panko, leaving 1 cm gap around the edges. Top with the combined ○ ingredients, and top with butter pieces. If you work on a baking sheet, it&#39;s easier afterwards..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Top with the other puff pastry. Crimp the edges together with a fork. Make several slits in the top pie crust with a knife, or pierce several times with a fork. If you brush the top with beaten egg, it will come out very shiny. I skipped this step..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake in a 200°C oven for 25 to 30 minutes. When it&#39;s nicely browned, it&#39;s done..
			
			
		</li>

		Really good apple pie can — and should — be easy to make.
	
		After all, part of the appeal of apple pie is its simplicity: Warmly spiced apples are baked until tender in a crisp, buttery crust.
	
		In a medium bowl add the sliced apples.
	
		Sprinkle with the sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt and toss gently to combine well.
	
		Work in butter with fingertips until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
