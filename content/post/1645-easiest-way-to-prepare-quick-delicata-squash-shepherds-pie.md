A deeply savoury lamb and vegetable filling While Shepherd&#39;s Pie is traditionally made with lamb, beef is just as tasty in this recipe. This is a timeless classic - make this once and you&#39;ll make it. Roasting delicata squash is far and away the best way to prepare it. Like other varieties of winter squash, the natural sugars in delicata squash are drawn out in the hot oven, which allows for beautiful caramelization as it becomes tender. As I mentioned above, the skin of delicata squash is so thin.
