As the pasta cooks, it releases its starch into the milk, thickening it up to give a glossy sauce. I added plenty of dried herbs, and the vegetables also help to make the sauce nice and tasty as it cooks! As a result, I have tried my fair share of vegan cheeses, ranging from soft cheeses worthy of fancy crackers to slices for grilled cheese sandwiches. And while I don&#39;t mind being cheese-free most of the time, the craving rears its ugly head every time I see an image of a gooey, stretchy pizza slice crossing my television screen. Although this pizza doesn&#39;t have sauce, it gets unforgettable flavor from a blend of cheeses, vegetables and garlic.
