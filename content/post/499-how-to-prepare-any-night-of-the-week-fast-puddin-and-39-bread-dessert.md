Silken tofu, rather than firm or extra firm, is used. When making desserts including tofu, most recipes will call for silken tofu rather than firm or extra-firm tofu; the texture makes a big difference, so be sure. Bread pudding is a dessert born of desperation. Using sourdough bread gives structure and integrity, and when it bakes, you get a wonderfully, balanced crispy crust. Beat together the eggs, melted butter, vanilla and milk.
