		Delicata squash is a variety of winter squash with cream-coloured cylindrical fruits striped in green or orange that are cooked.
	
		As its name suggests, it has characteristically a delicate rind (or skin).
	
		It is also known as peanut squash, Bohemian squash, or sweet potato squash.
	
		Shepherd&#39;s Pie is one of those foods that brings a smile to everyone&#39;s face - especially when you get seconds!

<h3>Instructions to make Delicata Squash Shepherds Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Heat 2 tbsp of coconut oil in a frying pan on medium-high heat. Let it get slightly hot, then add onions, celery and carrots. Stir and cook for about 10-11 minutes or until the onions are slightly translucent. Add the green chard and cook for another 5-7 minutes. Add the lentils, liquid smoke, mediterranean seasoning and tomato sauce to the veggies. Add another tbsp of coconut oil to keep the food from sticking to the pan. Cook for another 7-9 minutes. Set aside.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Clean and cube the squash. In small pot, put in the squash, water and bouillon then cook for approx. 20-30 minutes on medium heat. Check the squash with a fork. If it&#39;s soft enough to go thru the fork then it&#39;s ready. When it&#39;s ready pour half of the liquid out of the pot. Add the cooked mashed potatoes to the squash then start to mash the ingredients together. When it becomes a smooth mixture, stir until fully blended..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Take a 8&#34;or 9&#34; casserole dish and add the veggie mix to the dish. Evenly spread the mix throughout the dish. Take squash/potatoe mashed mix and put on top evenly coating the dish. Set oven to broil. Broil the dish for 10-15 minutes or until the top is nicely browned. Bon Appetite!.

		A deeply savoury lamb and vegetable filling While Shepherd&#39;s Pie is traditionally made with lamb, beef is just as tasty in this recipe.
	
		This is a timeless classic - make this once and you&#39;ll make it.
	
		Roasting delicata squash is far and away the best way to prepare it.
	
		Like other varieties of winter squash, the natural sugars in delicata squash are drawn out in the hot oven, which allows for beautiful caramelization as it becomes tender.
	
		As I mentioned above, the skin of delicata squash is so thin.
