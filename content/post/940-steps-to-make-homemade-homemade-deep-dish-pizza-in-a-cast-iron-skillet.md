- "Preparing the dough- Combine bread flour, cornbread mix, yeast, and seasonings (ground pepper, garlic powder, salt) to a large bowl and mix together evenly. Add water and mix until there is no flour left in the bowl and your dough is the proper texture. Cover and let sit for 8-12 hours (less if you use warm water)"

- "Assembling the pizza- First, add layer of cheese then slowly drip your sauce evenly over the cheese (it is harder to spread this way without displacing the cheese). Add your slices of sausage in a circular pattern, then add avocado slices between the sausage."
- "Bake on 450 degrees farenheight for 20-30 minutes depending on the size/thickness of your pizza. Let it rest for 15 minutes before cutting into and enjoy!"
