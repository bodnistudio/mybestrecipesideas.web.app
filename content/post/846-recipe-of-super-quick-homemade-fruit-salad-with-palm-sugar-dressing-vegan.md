Tossed with the pumpkin are cubed, crisp apples, pomegranate arils (or &#34;seeds&#34;), grapes - all delicious, seasonally autumn fruits - and a creamy dressing made with non-dairy yogurt and cinnamon. A sugar free version sounds awesome, but I didn&#39;t just want a bunch of chopped up fruit in a bowl. The classic recipe&#39;s sugar syrup does add something of value in bringing out flavours. It needs replacing, not just removing. Several ingredients replace the sugar in my fruit salad.
