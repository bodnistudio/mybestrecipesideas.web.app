<h3>Steps to make Sweet potato curry pie:</h3>

		<li>
			Add chicken broth and vegetables. Bring to a boil and cook for about 10 mins or until vegetables are almost tender..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Stir in Greek yogurt and cooked chicken..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Taste test! Add salt or more spices if needed. If you’d like the sauce thicker, add some tapioca starch. If you’d like it thinner, add more chicken broth or water..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Spoon into a casserole dish (or if you’re feeling fancy, into four individual croquettes). Cover with the unrolled (but intact) Pillsbury crescent roll dough. This works especially well if you use an oval-shaped casserole dish, otherwise you may need to rearrange a bit. If you’re using individual croquettes, two triangles per croquette works well..

			Beat egg with milk and brush onto crust. Bake for 15 mins or until golden brown, and serve!.
