##### The ingredients needed to make Fried rice with fruit:

Fried rice recipes typically call for Chinese-style medium-grain rice, though Thai-style versions use fragrant jasmine, and Japanese-style fried rice can even be made with short-grain sushi rice. I tried making fried rice with all of those, as well as with long-grain rice (standard Carolina and basmati rice) and parboiled rice (like Uncle Ben&#39;s). The key to Korean fried rice is to use one-day-old, leftover rice; freshly cooked rice causes the fried rice to be sticky and soggy in texture. I usually present this dish on a square plate.
