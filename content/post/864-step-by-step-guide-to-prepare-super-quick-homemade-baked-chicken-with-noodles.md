Y&#39;all know how much I love my dump-and-bake dinners, and this Chicken Noodle Casserole is no exception! My kids have always loved chicken noodle soup, but their favorite part of the soup is always the pasta and chicken — not the broth. As a result, I end up draining off a lot of the excess broth and instead serving them bowls of tender chicken, noodles, and veggies. I cut the chicken up into much smaller pieces then i dipped them in flour with salt,pepper and garlic powder. This chicken noodle casserole takes all the best elements of chicken noodle soup and bakes it up into a bubbly casserole.
