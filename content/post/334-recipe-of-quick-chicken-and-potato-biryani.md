This aromatic and mouthwatering chicken biryani is a family-favorite. In fact, I think I like chicken biryani just as much - possibly more than my butter chicken. That is saying A LOT y&#39;all. This style of Chicken Biryani is called the &#39;Pakki-Biryani&#39;, where the chicken and the rice are cooked separately and then combined in the final step.
