recipeinstructions:

- "Put the first ten ingredients (no flour) in a large mixing bowl. Mix well with a whisk. This is what I call a slough."

- "Transfer batter to prepared bundt pan using a rubber spatula/spoon. Tap pan on counter to ensure there are no air pockets."
- "Place cake on center rack of oven to bake 55-60 minutes. Cake will test with a pick."
- "Remove cake from oven and cool on a rack for 15 minutes, then remove from pan and finish cooling on rack."
- "Make the frosting by placing all the frosting ingredients in a medium bowl and mixing well with a wooden spoon."
- "Frost the cooled cake with the frosting using a butter knife."
- "Sprinkle a little pumpkin pie spice on top of cake for decoration."
- "Serves 12 generously. Keeps at room temp on a cake plate with a dome."
- "Note: If you wish, you can add up to one cup nuts to the cake batter. Add them when you add the flour. Walnuts would be my choice here. If you have a convection oven reduce temp to 325 and bake the same amount of time."
