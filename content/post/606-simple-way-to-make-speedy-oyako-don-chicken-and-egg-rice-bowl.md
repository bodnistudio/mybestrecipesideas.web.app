Donburi or Don is a Japanese name for large rice bowls that are bigger than ordinary rice bowls to serve any rice bowl dishes such as Gyu-don, Katsu-don and Miso Katsu-don. Oyakodon, a soupy rice bowl with bite-size chicken and softly cooked egg, is often overshadowed by its more glamorous cousins — katsudon, crowned with a golden breaded pork cutlet, and kaisendon, jeweled with sashimi But to describe oyakodon&#39;s layered textures and sweet-salty sauce of onions melting in soy, sake and mirin, the word magical comes up again and again This recipe, more subtly. Oyako-don (or Oyako-donburi) is quite popular but there are other popular donburi dishes such as &#39;katsu-don&#39; (カツ丼, pork cutlet with egg on rice), &#39;ten-don&#39; (天丼, tempura on rice), &#39;una-don&#39; (鰻丼, cooked eel on rice), and &#39;tekka-don&#39; (鉄火丼, tuna sashimi on rice).
