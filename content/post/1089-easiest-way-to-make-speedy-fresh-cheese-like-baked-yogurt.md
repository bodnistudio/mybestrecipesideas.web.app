recipeinstructions:
- "For salads: Bake the strained yogurt in a heatproof dish for 30 minutes at 170°C in the oven."
- "I use the bottom shelf of the oven, and check the condition frequently after 20 minutes not to burn the surface."
- "The yogurt in the photo is made with 1 pack of plain yogurt. I recommend to use a square dish as it helps to heat the yogurt evenly."
- "When this yogurt is freshly baked it has firmer texture. But the next day after refrigerating it overnight, the texture is more like cottage cheese."

- "If you are just making a small amount, you can use a toaster oven (bake for about 20 minutes)."
- "Drain off the liquid, slice the &#34;cheese&#34; and arrange with tomato slices to make a salad. The sliced &#34;cheese&#34; also goes well with wasabi soy sauce."
- "For pizza: Put the plain yogurt in a paper towel lined sieve or strainer, and leave it to drain very well overnight."
- "Spread sauce on your pizza crust base, then top with the drained yogurt instead of cheese. Sprinkle with salt and pepper."
- "If this yogurt &#34;cheese&#34; alone is not rich enough, add some pizza cheese too."
- "Then add whatever toppings you want such as vegetables, jalapeno peppers, sausage, salami etc. Bake the pizza as you normally would."
- "This is an Indian style curry made with the baked yogurt and eggplants. When it&#39;s simmered, the texture becomes even more cottage cheese-like."
