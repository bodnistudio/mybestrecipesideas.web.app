- "1 TSP Ginger"
- "50 g Chinese Chive"
- "50 g Bean sprouts"
- "300 g Pork spicy flavored"

recipeinstructions:
- "Bring a large pot of water to boil. Do not cook the noodle yet."
- "Cut seaweed into 4 sheets"
- "Boil water then put eggs for 7 min. Put the boiled eggs into the iced cold water for 2 minutes then crack them. (This way the egg shells are easy to peel)"
- "Slice them with egg slicer"
- "Separate chinese chives into root part and leaf part. Cut root part half inch size and leaf part into 2 inches size cut. (Because root side takes more time to sauté)"
- "Cut kimchi and pork into bite size."
- "Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Sauté garlic and ginger for one minute to get the aroma."
- "Add pork and cook for 5 min with high heat. You don’t want to move the meat too much to get the crispiness"
- "(This time, we used already flavored meat but if you are using non-flavored meat, you can flavor with salt, pepper, red chili pepper and ginger power before you sauté)"
- "Add root side chinese chives then stir until chives are soft, 1 minute."
- "Add kimchi and sauté for 3 minutes."
- "Turn off the heat then add leaf side chinese chives and bean sprouts then stir them well. (They will be cooked with left over heat)"
- "Now you can cook noodles, don’t over cook it. Set the timer for one minute shorter for Al dente. This time we used these noodles but you can use anything you like."
- "Decorate them pretty and enjoy!"
