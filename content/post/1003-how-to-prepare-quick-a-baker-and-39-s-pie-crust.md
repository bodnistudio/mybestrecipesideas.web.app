recipeinstructions:
- "Sift the flour and salt together into a bowl. Add the chilled cream cheese and butter, and break them up with a fork while coating them with the flour."
- "When the lumps have become small, break up the rest of the lumps with the back of the fork. When it looks crumbly all over as shown in the photo, it&#39;s ready."
- "Make a well in the middle and pour in the chilled water. Gather the flour mixture into the middle, and press down with your palms (don&#39;t knead it) to form into one mass."
- "The dough should be crumbly, not smooth. Wrap in plastic film and leave to rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours or more. The pie crust dough is done."
- "Roll out the filling and wrap any filling you like in it. Brush with egg wash and bake until golden brown. Bake for 10 minutes at 200째C, then lower the temperature to 180째C and bake for another 15 to 18 minutes."
- "Notes: Roll the rested dough out a little, and fold into thirds. Roll out and fold again, for a total of 3 times. You can omit this step, but this will result in a pie crust with very nice layers. Even a tough pie crust will become tender and easy to handle."
- "I combined the cream cheese left over from making the crust with homemade jam to make the filling."
- "I tried making a mille feuille pie with honey lemon and custard."
- "You can make a variety of pies with this recipe. I like arranging them in baskets to present them as gifts."
