recipeingredient:
- "8 large potatoes cut into chunks"
- "3 tbsp vegetable oil for meat"
- "1 large onion minced"
- "6 large baby bello mushrooms minced"
- "1 tsp salt for meat"
- "1 tsp ground black pepper for meat"
- "2 lb ground beef"
- "3 tbsp steak sauce"
- "3 large eggs"
- "2 tbsp vegetable oil for veggies"
- "1/3 stick butter for veggies"
- "3 large carrots chopped"
- "8 oz corn niblets"
- "8 oz peas"
- "1 tsp salt for veggies"
- "1 cup milk"
- "1 stick butter for potatoes"
- "1 tsp salt for potatoes"
- "1/2 cup cheddar cheese grated"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large pot, boil the potatoes until soft."
- "In a large saucepan, heat the oil on low."
- "Add the onion, mushrooms, salt, snd pepper, and cook until translucent."
- "Add the meat, incorporate, and cook through.  NOTE: I used beef but, obviously, ground lamb could also be used, if you can find it at the supermarket.  I couldn&#39;t when I put this together, but I still called it Shepherd&#39;s Pie because, like with Minced Meat Pies no longer having meat in them these days, just about everyone I know makes Shepherd&#39;s Pie with beef, so I figured no harm, no foul.  If you are pedantic, I could have called this Cottage Pie, but, in the US, I don&#39;t think anyone knows what it is.  Besides, I figured, who would want to be that guy, right?"
- "Stir in the steak sauce, and let cool."
- "When cooled, stir in the eggs, and pour the mixture into the bottom of the large casserole.  The eggs will firm up the bottom to provide a solid base."
- "Add the butter, oil, and carrots into the now-empty large saucepan, and simmer on medium until tender."
- "Add the corn niblets, peas, and salt, and mix and simmer until it&#39;s all happy and tender."
- "Layer the veggies on the meat in the casserole."
- "Drain, return to the pot, and mash the potatoes on low."
- "Add butter and salt while mashing.  I know, it&#39;s a lot of butter, so cut it down to 2/3 stick if you like."
- "Add the milk to the potatoes.  It will be loose at first, but it will firm up a bit while you stir it in a few minutes."
- "When the potatoes are stackably firm, scoop it on top of the casserole."
- "Throw it all in the oven at 375°F for 45 minutes."
- "OK, it will have this beautiful crust after 45min, and you are just going to sprinkle the cheddar over the top."
- "Broil for about 5 min, keeping an eye on it after 3 minutes to be sure it doesn&#39;t burn, to melt the cheese."
- "Remove from heat and try to let it cool about a half hour before diving in.  As can be seen from my pic, I always fail.  Enjoy."
