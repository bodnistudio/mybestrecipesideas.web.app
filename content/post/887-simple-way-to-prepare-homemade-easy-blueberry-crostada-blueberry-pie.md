<h3>Steps to make Easy Blueberry Crostada (Blueberry Pie):</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			To make the crust combine the flour,salt and sugar in a large bowl.  Take the butter (which should be ice cold) and cut it into small 1 inch cubes and mix it into the bowl with your hands. use both your hands and mix the butter pieces into the flour mix. Do this for about 1 minute. You should have a bowl of pea size pieces of flour and butter.  Now add 1 teaspoon of iced water  into the flour mix and again mix slowly with your hands.  Now grab a clump of dough in your fist - if it hold togeth....
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Once you have the dough ready, take a sheet of parchment paper and lay it on your kitchen counter.  Put the dough on it and start kneading the dough softly with your hands so as to form one big mound of dough. Then divide the dough into two and wrap in plastic wrap and keep one in the freezer(for later use) and refrigerate the other one for 1 hour..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			While the dough is refrigerating, wash and dry the blueberries(I washed them in a big strainer and transferred to a big tray and used a paper towel to wipe off moisture).  Then transfer the berries to a medium size bowl, add the sugar, corn starch and the salt and mix slowly and gently with a rubber spatula(if you have one) just so you don&#39;t squeeze the berries too hard. Make sure all the corn starch and sugar is mixed uniformly with the berries.  There your filling is ready..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Next after the dough has been in the fridge for an hour, get it back on the parchment paper on your counter.  Whack it gently using your rolling pin to loosen it up. Then put some flour on the parchment paper and also on your rolling pin and roll the dough slowly into a circle about 12 inches long.  every now and then make sure its not sticking to the parchment by adding more dusting flour..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Preheat oven to 400 deg F..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Next, slide the parchment paper with the pastry dough  circle onto a large baking sheet/tray. Now place the filling slowly and carefully in the middle of the pastry dough and slowly use the parchment paper to fold the outside edges of the pastry dough around the outside of the filling leaving only the inside filling exposed.(see picture)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Lastly, brush the outside edges of the pastry with ice water and sprinkle sugar all over the tops and edges.  Bake at 400 degrees F for about 45-50 minutes. I would recommend checking after 35 minutes to see if the filling is boiling. It should boil for about 5 minutes so that the corn starch dissolves completely..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Take the crostada out of the oven when the crust is nice and golden and the filling has been bubbling for about 5 minutes. Enjoy!.
