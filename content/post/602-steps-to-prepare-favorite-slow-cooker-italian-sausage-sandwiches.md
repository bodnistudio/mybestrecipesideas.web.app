These hot Italian sausages are reminiscent of the kind you&#39;ll find on street corners in Italy. Our version simmers to perfection in a flavorful mix of peppers, onions and tomato! Set the slow cooker to simmer all day, and you can come home to a spicy-sweet tomato sauce to ladle over noodles. But I call this slow cooker Italian sausage soup my &#34;postmodern chicken soup&#34; because it is chicken soup, kicked up about ten levels. In this recipe, you simply get the sausage out of its casing - no need to make meatballs because when you brown the sausage, it crumbles into little balls anyway.
