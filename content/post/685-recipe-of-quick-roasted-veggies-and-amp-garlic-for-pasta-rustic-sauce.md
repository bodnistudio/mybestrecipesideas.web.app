Be sure to check the veggies as they cook, and just keep going until they&#39;re nice and lovely with dark bits around the edges. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray. Place broccoli florets, mushrooms, butternut squash, zucchini, squash, bell pepper and onion in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Roast veggies in a single layer in a heavy, shallow-sided roasting pan, like a jelly roll pan. If the pan is too small or the vegetables too crowded, they&#39;ll steam, and you want them to be crisp.
