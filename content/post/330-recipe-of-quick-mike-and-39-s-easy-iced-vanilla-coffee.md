To make a simple iced coffee, brew a cup of coffee on the stronger side since the ice will water it down. If you want to add sugar, do so now as it will dissolve better in a hot drink. Then, let the coffee cool down to room temperature, then place it in the refrigerator. Generally, iced coffee is made stronger than normal coffee because the water from the ice does dissolve it a bit. There&#39;s even a bit of history.
