The one below is the classic way I usually prepare it. How to make and form the Dough:-When making Homemade Pizza Dough be sure to knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic.-Let it rise in a lightly oiled bowl (make sure to turn the dough in the bowl so it gets covered lightly in oil), cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a clean large kitchen cloth. Spray the muffin tin with cooking spray and put the dough in the bottom of each cup. Add a layer of mozzarella cheese on top of the dough. This helps keep the dough from getting soggy.
