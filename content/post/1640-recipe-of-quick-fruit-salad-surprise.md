##### The ingredients needed to make Fruit Salad Surprise:

1. Make ready 3 cup of fruits in season
1. Get 1/3 cup of any type of sugar
1. Prepare 1 dash of an whole orange,lemon or 6 limes
1. Make ready 1 pinch of sprinkles or nuts (optional)
1. Take 2 pints of your favourite sherbet,ice cream or yougurt


When it hits those fruits the juices come out even more and combine with the dry pudding mix to form a delicious fruit salad dressing that will surprise you by how delicious it is! Add strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, mango, orange sections. (Of course any of the fruit is optional and you can mix and match what you want. Lots of times I will leave the orange sections out because it&#39;s more time consuming to cut.) Add enough orange juice only partially cover the fruit. The more fruit obviously the more orange juice.
