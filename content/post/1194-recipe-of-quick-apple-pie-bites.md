<h3>Instructions to make Apple pie bites:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Preheat oven to 350 °F and spray cookie sheet with non stick spray.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Slice the apples and set them aside, the apple slices depend on the size of the apple.  I got 8 slices from my red delicious apple, but size and amount of apple can vary.  You could also lightly sautée the apples in a tbsp of butter and then use them according to the directions. However the apple will be appropriately cooked if you place it in the roll raw. Mix the brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg in a bowl. Unroll a raw individual crescent roll and press 1 1/2 tbsp of the brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg mixture into the wide end of the dough and place a slice of apple inside, roll in up as you would if you were preparing a classic crescent roll.  You can place the rolls on a cookie sheet and place in the oven just like that or you could mix a tbsp of cinnamon and a tsp of white sugar together and sprinkle it on the top of the rolls before placing them in the oven..
