Substitute low sodium chicken broth for wine like I did. This will add extra flavor to the dish and it will deglaze the pan. Use water instead of wine or chicken broth, but keep in mind the dish will lack in flavor so maybe add. Shrimp scampi is easy to make and feels like a restaurant-quality meal.
