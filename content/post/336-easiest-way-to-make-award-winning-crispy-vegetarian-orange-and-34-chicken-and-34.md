- "1 lb seitan sliced bite sized pieces"
- "2 large eggs whisked well"
- "1/2 tsp salt"

recipeinstructions:
- "Mix miso paste with warm water until completely dissolved. Add the orange juice, sugar, soy sauce and vinegar. Mix well."
- "Heat the sesame oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic, ginger and crushed red pepper. Sauté until fragrant. Be careful! It&#39;ll brown quickly!"
- "Add the orange juice &amp; miso mixture to the saucepan. Mix well and bring to a simmer."
- "While bringing sauce to a simmer, mix together 1 tbsp cornstarch with 3 tbsp cool water to form a thin mixture. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the sauce. Simmer until thickened. Cover and set sauce to the side."

Place fried seitan on paper towels to drain excess oil."
- "Once all the seitan has been fried and drained, place in a large bowl. Drizzle the warm orange glaze over the seitan and toss well. Serve over rice and garnish with fresh scallions."
