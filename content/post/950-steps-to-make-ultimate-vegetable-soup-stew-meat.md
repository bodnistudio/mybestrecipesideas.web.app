Having never made vegetable soup I was a little leery especially since my husband is hard to please. Not only is this easy but it is also tasty and made my house smell Was pretty good i would just rather stew beef instead of ground beef. This crockpot soup is more of a hearty and filling stew than just another vegetable soup. Filled with potatoes, green split peas, carrots, celery, and plenty of spices, one bowl of this stew is low in calories but high in fiber, and the perfect weeknight dinner served with bread and a salad.
