We love to use beautiful, fresh sweet strawberries in this Strawberry Banana Oatmeal Breakfast Smoothie. For the banana, we like to use frozen. We buy tons of bananas at the store and let them get a bit brown. Once the bananas are brown we peel them and freeze the bananas for smoothies, blend into juices or even make banana ice cream!
