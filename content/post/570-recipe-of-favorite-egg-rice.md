In a saucepan bring water, salt and soy sauce to a boil. Egg fried rice in its absolute purest form—nothing but eggs, rice, cooking oil, soy sauce, and scallions—is one of the simplest stir-fries around. But like all simple foods—pizza, grilled cheese, a roasted chicken&amp;mash;it&#39;s the details of the process that elevate its basic ingredients into something transcendental. when the egg is cooked, move it into a bowl. add rice to the bowl and sort of mix it just so that the egg and rice are no longer separated. add soy sauce and sesame oil. the sesame oil will help the egg and rice mix well. adding sesame seeds is optional, but it gives it a good taste. make sure the soy sauce is well mixed in with the rice. enjoy! cooking notes for egg fried rice Try to use day-old rice : Fried rice is usually a dish that you make to repurpose the leftover cooked rice from the day before.
