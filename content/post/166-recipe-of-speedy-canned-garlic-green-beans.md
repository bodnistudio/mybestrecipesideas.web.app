recipeingredient:
- "1 gallon fresh green beans trimmed"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "2 clove garlic peeled and split"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place cleaned, trimmed, and cut beans in a pot(each gallon of whole beans equals 1 pint -- I just eyeball the amount of beans with a 5-gallon bucket)."
- "Cover the beans with water."
- "Being the pot to a boil. Once it reaches boiling, allow the beans to boil for 5 minutes."
- "While the beans are boiling, sterilize a pint jar per gallon of beans in a separate pot of hot water (do not put cold jars in boiling water! Heat the jars in a few inches of water in the canning pot until the water boils. This doesn&#39;t just sterilize the jars, it also makes it so they won&#39;t break when you add the hot beans)."
- "Remove the jar with canning tongs. While the jar is still not, add 1/2 tsp salt and 2 split cloves of garlic."
- "Ladle hot beans into the jar. When it&#39;s full, push them down with a wooden spoon and add more until the jar is snugly packed."
- "Pour hit cooking liquid over the beans up to 1/2-inch below the rim of the jar."
- "Wipe the rim of the jar dry with a clean paper towel."
- "Place a clean, dry metal lid on the jar and screw on the metal ring on just until it stops turning."
- "Place the jar(s) in simmering water in the pressure canner. Add more water if necessary to bring the water up to about 2 inches up the sides of the jar(s)."
- "Process the jars on high for 20 minutes."
