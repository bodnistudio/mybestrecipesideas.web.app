Nothing at all like fluffy, chewy, soft, and crispy white pizza crust that we all know and love. The wheat gives it good texture and its baked texture is like pizza should be, thick enough to hold toppings but not so thick as to be like eating pizza off sliced bread. My favorite part of this recipe is that you can get three meals from one short &#34;bread making&#34; session. This is quite possibly the best pizza dough recipe I&#39;ve ever seen!

So easy and great for our fmaily of pizza lovers. I even tried freezing the individual pizza shells between layers of parchment paper WITHOUT freezing them seperately first, and it worked just fine.be careful when unpeeling the paper from the frozen shells, but this does save one more step for you busy cooks! It hardly needs kneading or rising time. You can make this pizza in less than the amount of time it would take for pizza delivery. Wheat: Pizza by Jay is a Calgary (central NW) based takeout &amp; delivery pizza restaurant.
