Try RICOTTA CHEESE instead of sour cream and skip the provolone for a real Italian version of Baked Ziti. Mix an egg into a pound of ricotta to make it nice and creamy, and toss with the ziti. Layer sauce first (so you don&#39;t need to butter the pan), then ziti/cheese, mozzarella, sprinkle with parm and a little dried oregano or basil, then.

Baked Ziti is a classic baked pasta dish. It&#39;s basically some kind of tomato or meat sauce baked in a dish with some kind of cheese and, of course, ziti noodles—unless you&#39;re me, then you use mostaciolli noodles. Some people just use tomato/marinara sauce. That, of course, would never fly in this house.
