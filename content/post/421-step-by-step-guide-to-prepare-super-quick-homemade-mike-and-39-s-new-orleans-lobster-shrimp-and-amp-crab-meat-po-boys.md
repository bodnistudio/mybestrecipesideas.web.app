- "In a pan with a lifted rack and tight fitting lid - add these ingredients to taste. Butter - White Wine - Minced Garlic - Fresh Lemon Juice - Lemon Pepper - Old Bay and bring all to a simmer. Add what you&#39;d like and how you&#39;d like it but don&#39;t allow your fluids to rise above your rack and touch your lobster tails. You want to steam - not boil."
