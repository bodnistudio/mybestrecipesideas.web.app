- "Spread half (or 1/3 depending on how many portions of dough you have) of the tomato sauce over the pizza base, space out the mozzarella slices, and add any of the additional toppings. Drizzle with a little bit of olive oil."
- "Slide the pizza from the cutting board onto the upside-down tray in the oven. Bake for about 5 minutes on full heat."
