Spin vegetables dry in a salad spinner, or pat dry on a paper towel-lined sheet tray. Stir with a spoon until homogenous, then set aside, leaving the spoon in the bowl. Dry-fry the cashews in a large saucepan or casserole dish over a medium heat until golden brown.

##### The ingredients needed to make Vegetable smoky Fried RiceðŸ˜Š:

1. Make ready 2 cups cooked rice/left over rice
1. Prepare 1 cup mixed vegetables (any veg you have in fridge)
1. Prepare 3 cloves garlic
1. Prepare 3 green chillies,

1. Prepare 1 tbsp chilli sauce

You can, of course, use any mix of frozen vegetables or fresh vegetables. I often use a mixture of both depending on what I need to use up in the fridge. Fried rice recipes typically call for Chinese-style medium-grain rice, though Thai-style versions use fragrant jasmine, and Japanese-style fried rice can even be made with short-grain sushi rice. I tried making fried rice with all of those, as well as with long-grain rice (standard Carolina and basmati rice) and parboiled rice (like Uncle Ben&#39;s). really easy and yummy!
