I love to pair this buttercream with my chocolate cupcakes and make my Cafe Mocha Cupcakes. You can also pair this amazing frosting with vanilla cupcakes or chocolate chip cupcakes. You can make this with your choice of instant coffee, my favorite to use is this one. The cupcakes tasted like an amazing combination of Mocha and Espresso - I could taste it in the batter and in the cupcake after it came out of the oven. I came back to Vancouver, Canada and baked these with a Nespresso coffee again, and they tasted quite different - not like the amazing combination I recalled in New Jersey.
