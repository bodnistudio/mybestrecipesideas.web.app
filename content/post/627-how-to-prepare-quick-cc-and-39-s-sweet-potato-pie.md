		Sweet potatoes are sweeter than pumpkins, and though the pies are usually made in the same way with eggs.
	
		Sweet potato pie is lighter yet creamier than its pumpkin cousin, with a heavy dose of vanilla and subtle spices.
	
		Beyond tasting better, sweet potato pie is easier to bake.
	
		It doesn&#39;t require cooking the filling, as the sweet potatoes are fully baked in advance, and the pie crust doesn&#39;t require blind.
