recipeinstructions:
- "Add all ingredients except cream cheese, milk, and potato flakes to 7 qt crockpot. Cook on HIGH 4-5 hours until potatoes are fork tender. Add cream cheese, milk, and potato flakes. Stir to combine CAREFULLY , crock pot will be VERY FULL.  Taste soup and add desired salt and pepper.

Do NOT  leave on warm overnight or you&#39;ll just have a goopy pot of mashed potatoes."
