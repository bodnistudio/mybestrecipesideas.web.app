The flavors are straightforward and kid-friendly, with tender broccoli taking on nutty goodness from browned butter and a floral lift from lemon zest. We like the mild flavor of gluten-free corn-and-quinoa pasta, but any whole-grain pasta (such as spelt or brown-rice versions) would be great as well. Melt the butter in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Continue to cook until it turns golden brown (but not dark brown). Add the lemon juice and capers and stir.
