- "Bake for another 5-7 minutes, until the base starts to crisp."
- "Now remove from the oven and add your tomato puree, chopped tomatoes and mozzarella cheese."
- "Return to the oven for a couple of minutes, until the cheese is beginning to melt. Then add your other toppings - I like chorizo (finely sliced), ham and pineapple. Spread these evening over your base and top with grated cheddar."
- "Return to the oven, but this time on grill setting. Grill until your toppings begin to crisp. Remove from the oven and ENJOY!"
