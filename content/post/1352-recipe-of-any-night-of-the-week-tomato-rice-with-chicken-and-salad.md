This Vietnamese Chicken Salad starts with the tangy, salty, lime-and-garlic-y dressing, which totally shines with the cooling mint + cilantro and a handful of fiery-crisp serrano peppers, which all results in me wrapping my fork with a combination of spicy-cool, salty-tangy veggies, chicken, and NOODLES. Strips of chicken breast are tossed with spiced rice, flaked almonds, sliced apple, cherry tomatoes and long stem broccoli to make a colourful, filling and portable lunch. Simply pack into a plastic container, pop into a cool bag with a couple of ice blocks and keep well chilled. One pan chicken tomato with rice is out of this world. I make it up at once a month I use chicken thighs as I like the taste, but you can use boneless skinless breasts if you like.
