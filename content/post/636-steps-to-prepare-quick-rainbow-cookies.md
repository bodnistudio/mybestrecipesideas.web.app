- "1 each flour for dusting if batter is soft"
- "1 rainbow sprinkles"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350Â°F."
- "Make mix according to instructions.  I used Betty Crocker sugar cookie mix and followed the regular instructions instead of the cut out or roll out options.  (This is why the flour was needed to help work the batter.)"
- "Evenly divide the batter into 4 or five portions.  Add one chosen food color to each divided portion.  I used pink, purple, blue, green and regular food color yellow.  Now just FYI ... You can eliminate the yellow and it will look just fine and stretch out the batter."
- "Take a grape size or smaller portion of each color and roll into a ball.  Then roll each ball together to make a bigger ball.  It will look like a beach ball.  (The flour comes into play here by dusting your hands with it to roll each ball and then dust lightly the surface for the next step.)"
- "Now take the ball and roll into a 6 inch long cylinder (log).  Then wrap it like the big lollipops or a pinwheel, twisting the log so more colors show."
- "And now add your sprinkles.  The pinterest picture shows the sprinkles around the edges, but I just sprinkled mine over the top because it was hard to handle."
- "Put them in the oven on a greased cookie sheet or lined with parchment paper.  Bake for 10 to 11 minutes or until there is a light brown around edges."
- "Note* You can use any color you want.  And you have to watch the size of each color because the cookie will spread in the oven.  The sprinkles are optional.  And the original recipe said one package yielded 14 balls of each cookie.  I used three packages and managed 54 cookies.  Some with less colors."
