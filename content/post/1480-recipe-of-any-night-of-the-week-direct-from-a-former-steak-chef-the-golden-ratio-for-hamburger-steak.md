- "When the onion and garlic from Step 1 has cooled down, combine with the Step 2 mixture."
- "Add the ground meat...(choose ground meat that&#39;s pink instead of red. Although you don&#39;t need to get too hung up on this.)"
- "Mix and knead well! Do this by hand, ok? It&#39;s loose but don&#39;t worry! Rest the mixtured for several hours in the refrigerator. The paté will stiffen up."
- "Take it out of the refrigerator - wow! It&#39;s become a lot stiffer! Form into patties, and let&#39;s cook them in a frying pan! Brown them on both sides over high-medium heat, then cook on both sides over low heat."
