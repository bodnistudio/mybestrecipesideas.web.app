This spicy Dutch-Indonesian peanut sauce has become part and parcel of the modern Dutch kitchen. In fact, in the Netherlands today, satay sauce is not only enjoyed with Indonesian classics such as the eponymous skewered meat dish or gado-gado, but also with Dutch-style fries and barbecued meats. This satay sauce can be prepared well in advance and keeps well for several days when chilled. Popular throughout Southeast Asia and Indonesia, satay is strips of skewered, grilled meat eaten with a fragrant dipping sauce.

Here we serve seasoned marinated steak with a spicy peanut sauce for dipping. A simple cucumber salad is a cooling counterpoint to the beef satay. Spear four pieces of meat tightly on each skewer until all the chicken has been skewered. Good recipe, but a bit conflicting. The flavour of the marinated chicken is quite powerful on its own.
