While tea isn&#39;t going to be able to treat serious illness on its own, it can help ease certain symptoms like a sore throat. Many teas contain antioxidants, which are compounds that can help your body fight illnesses like colds and other viruses. Tea also provides a perfect vehicle for honey, a natural antibacterial and soothing sore throat agent.

Sore throat tea is one of the most favored of current trending foods in the world. It is appreciated by millions daily. It's easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They are nice and they look wonderful. Sore throat tea is something that I've loved my whole life.


To begin with this recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook sore throat tea using 5 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook it.

As unbelievable as this sounds, this Moroccan Sore Throat Tea is probably one of the best discoveries we had in Morocco. After spending a bone-chilling night in a desert camp in the middle of the Sahara, I got sick. However, when I&#39;ve got just a little baby sore throat, and nothing ibuprofen can&#39;t fix, I opt for this tea.

Plus it tastes miles better than that protective blend ðŸ˜‰ Ingredients. There isn&#39;t actually any tea in this concoction. Ginger is a good herb tea for sore throats because of its anti-inflammatory properties. It kills bacteria, flushes out toxins, and boosts circulation. Because a cup of tea made from ginger plant roots leaves a pungent taste in the mouth, it activates the release of secretions that help clear the throat.
