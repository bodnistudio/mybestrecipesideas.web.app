If you have the time using fresh roasted puree is going to improve the filling. The filling is quick and easy to make, and all you need to do is mix all the ingredients together. Make sure to add the filling to the crust while it&#39;s still warm. I do more sweet potato pies than pumpkin and I don&#39;t want to have to buy one heavy cream for one singular pie. Many pumpkin pie recipes call for evaporated milk and I often get asked if you can substitute sweetened condensed milk for evaporated milk in the MyÂ Pumpkin Pie with Sweetened Condensed Milk just might be the easiest pumpkin pie that you can make.
