			Notes written by my mother. I use the smallest amount of ice water to mix it into a ball. Adding a bit more butter will allow you to mix it into a ball without using any water. I use the pastry cutter instead of a fork, adding the least amount of water possible. I also cut the flour mixture until it is grainy, not the size of peas. Use plastic wrap on the bottom and top of the pie crust when rolling it out as not to add more flour..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes, rotating at 7 minutes..
