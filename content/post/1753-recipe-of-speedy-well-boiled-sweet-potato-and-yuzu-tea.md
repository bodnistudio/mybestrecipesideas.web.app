recipeingredient:
- " Japanese sweet potato"
- " Yuzu tea base"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the sweet potatoes into about 1 cm thick slices and soak in water. Then, put the sweet potatoes in a pot and put in enough water so it&#39;s just bit less than what you&#39;d need to cover them up. Turn on the heat."
- "Once they begin to boil, add the yuzu tea base. Boil covered over low heat for about 9 minutes while occasionally mixing gently so that the tea doesn&#39;t clump into one place."
- "Once 9 minutes has passed, remove the lid and check the potatoes with a skewer. If they&#39;re just a bit firm in the middle, they&#39;re good! Cover with the lid again and remove from the heat."
- "Wait for a bit and check with a skewer again. If you can pass it through easily, they&#39;re ready! You can store them along with the liquid. They&#39;re so glossy!"
- "They have a pretty yuzu color!"
- "They&#39;re great for a bento, too."
