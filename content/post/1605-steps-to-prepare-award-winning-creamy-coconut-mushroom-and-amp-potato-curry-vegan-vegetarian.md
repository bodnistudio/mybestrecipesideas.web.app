This creamy garlic mushroom recipe is as versatile as it is delicious. Of course, the cream needs to be replaced with something else. My favourite is coconut milk, or especially coconut cream; I love. Introducing this one-skillet saut√©ed tempeh served in a creamy, peppery, and rich mushroom coconut sauce. Tempeh is first cut into bite-size cubes.
