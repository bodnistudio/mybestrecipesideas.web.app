- "2 pinch Salt"
- "2 dash Pepper"
- "2 dash Nutmeg"
- "1 Eggs"
- "6 tbsp Panko"
- "5 tbsp Milk"

recipeinstructions:
- "Finely chop the onion."

- "In another bowl, mix the minced meat with salt, pepper and nutmeg, stir until you see the fibrous strands from the meat (see photo)."

- "Add the onion and knead well again. Do this until the fat from the meat mixture sticks to the sides of the bowl."
- "Divide the mixture into 2, shape them roughly and store in the fridge for 1-2 hours. This allows the meat mixture to settle, reducing the chance of the burger splitting when cooked."

- "Serve on a plate. This is a plump, tender, juicy hamburger steak."
- "Served with a neatly arranged side salad. I used grated daikon radish and ate it with ponzu sauce."
- "It&#39;s normal to use a 1:1 mixture of Japanese Worcestershire-style sauce and tomato ketchup to use as the sauce on these, but it&#39;s even better if you add a little lemon juice."
