recipeingredient:
- " Milk Bread Dough"
- "3 cup bread flour"
- "1/4 cup sugar"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1 tsp instant yeast"
- "1 egg"
- "4 tbsp unsalted butter softened and cubed"
- "3/4 cup soy milk warm"
- " Topping Dough"
- "1 cup allpurpose flour"
- "2/3 cup sugar"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "1/4 tsp baking powder"
- "1/4 cup milk powder"
- "1 egg yolk"
- "4 tbsp unsalted butter softened and cubed"
- "2 tbsp water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the milk bread dough."
- "In the bowl of a stand mixer, mix together the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, instant yeast). Then add 1 egg."
- "Using the dough hook, mix the ingredients on stir/low speed. Slowly pour in the milk while stirring. Knead for 2 mins until a sticky dough forms."
- "Add the unsalted butter that has been cut into small cubes. Continue kneading the dough on stir/low speed for 10 mins."
- "Check if the dough has become smooth. If not, may continue kneading for 3-5 mins."
- "Cover the dough in a bowl. Let it rise until size doubles, about 1-1.5 hours."
- "Make the topping dough."
- "In a medium-large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking soda and powder, milk powder and 1 egg yolk."
- "Add the softened butter and mix well. Add 2 tbsp water, one at a time."
- "Using your hand, gather and press the dough mixture. The dough starts out dry but your hand will help melt the butter and dough will smooth out until it no longer sticks much to your hand."
- "Roll the topping dough into a log. Wrap in plastic or put in covered container. Place in fridge to chill until bread dough finishes 1st proof."
- "Form the bread dough."
- "After the bread dough has doubled in size, take it out of the bowl and place on a lightly floured surface. Press hard to squeeze the air out. Knead by hand a few times."
- "Weigh the dough and equally divide into 10 or 12 buns, depending on your preference for size."
- "Shape the dough into balls. Place on baking sheet and loosely covered. Let rise for 2nd time until doubled in size again, about 1 hour."
- "Shape the topping dough and assemble buns."
- "Take topping dough out of fridge. Weigh and equally divide into 10 or 12 pieces to match the number of buns."
- "Roll each piece into a ball. Gently press or roll into a flat round disc that is slightly smaller than the bun&#39;s surface. Gently score a grid onto the topping to make the &#34;pineapple&#34; net-like pattern."
- "Preheat oven to 350°F."
- "When buns have doubled in size again after 2nd proof, place one piece of topping dough onto each bun. Use a piece of plastic wrap or a flat dough scraper to help transfer onto bun."
- "[Optional] Mix 1 egg yolk with a bit of water and brush onto topping for extra shine and golden color. (I like to skip this to save an egg.)"
- "Bake the buns for about 15 mins at 350°F or until lightly golden."
- "Enjoy fresh! Or toast in oven to make the top crunchy again on the following day."
