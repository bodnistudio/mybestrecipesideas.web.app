Veal &#34;steak&#34; would be an unusual cut, though, since it is most commonly sold as chops, cutlets, shoulder--anything but what I think of as a nice thick &#34;steak.&#34; Would it be a T-bone? Except for a veal &#34;chop,&#34; I can&#39;t think of any other common cut of veal that resembles any common (beef) steak cut. Butter-tender filet mignon complemented perfectly with hearty strip steak. The best way to cook t-bone steak is on the grill.
