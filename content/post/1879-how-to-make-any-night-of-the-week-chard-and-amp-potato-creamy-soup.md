- "1 box chicken broth"
- "4 cup chard"
- "1 potato cubed"
- "1 carrot cubed"
- "1 poblano chile pepper"
- "1 green tomato"
- "1/2 onion chopped"
- "1 dollop heavy cream crema media"
- "2 tbsp oil vegetable olive soy whatever"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a soup pot, cook onion, potato, and carrot in oil on medium heat"
- "In another pan, heat the poblano chile and green tomato on medium-high heat, flipping them every few minutes until their skins char and pucker. Peel them carefully (so as not to burn yourself) to an extent possible"
- "In the meantime, once the onion, carrot, and potato have cooked, add chicken broth to the pot. Bring it to a boil."
- "Add the peeled, seeded chile and the peeled green tomato to the pot. After 15 minutes or so, add the coarsely chopped chard to the pot."
- "Once all has cooked thoroughly, blend the soup using a hand blender or with a normal blender."
- "Add a dollop of cream to taste and for color (and garnish!)"
- "Provecho! Words of caution: I didn&#39;t find salt to be very necessary in this soup. It has so much flavor as it is, so season with caution. The green tomato adds a lot of acidity, so use good judgment in the size of your tomato. If it&#39;s too big, your resulting soup may be on the sour side. Make sure your soup is not boiling when you add the cream! Keep it heated on a low flame or else your cream won&#39;t become one with the soup, and it&#39;ll look like your soup has pond scum floating on top."
