		Really, does it get any easier?
	
		You can use a homemade crust or a store bought crust, but you&#39;ll want a deep dish crust either way to make sure it.
	
		Sure, pecan pie is great on it&#39;s own, but coconut and chocolate make it ten times better.
	
		Scatter pecans, chips, and coconut over bottom of pie shell; place on a baking sheet.
