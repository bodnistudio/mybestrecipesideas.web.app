Ciabatta is somewhat elongated, broad, and flat, and is baked in many variations. Transfer steak to a cutting board and place ciabatta halves, cut side down, on the grill to toast. Ciabatta is a funny kind of bread. Far from the golden domed boules or slender baguettes, this Italian bread is lumpy, rather flat, and most definitely rustic.
