<h3>Steps to make Tinklee&#39;s Apple Pie Moonshine:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			add apple juice, cider, sugars and cinnamon sticks to a good stock pan; and bring to a boil,  keeping it covered, let simmer for 30mins.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			take off heat, leaving cover on, and let cool down(do this on its own speeding up the process can break it down), should take 4-6hrs.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			stir in your 190proof (everclear) and fireball.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			put 1 apple slice in each jar (I use pint size), then strain through a cheesecloth or coffee filter and fill the jars and seal with lid.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			I use pint size jars, this is best after it has aged for a couple months, so by making it in pints some do age pretty good, they are great easy for sipping lets the rest sit and keep aging, and their the prefect size for gifts also this way! enjoy.
