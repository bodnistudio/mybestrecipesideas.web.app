A bowl made out of pizza crust is actually pretty genius—Olive Garden&#39;s version of the bread bowl pizza is just over-the-top enough. These edible bowls are a fun alternative to a traditional slice of pizza, and everyone can customize their own. Let stand until bubbles form on surface. Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. It&#39;s extremely easy to double and works just as well, so we usually make a double batch and put one pizza in the freezer to eat sometime later.
