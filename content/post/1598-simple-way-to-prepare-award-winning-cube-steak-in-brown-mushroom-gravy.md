- "4 tbs butter  divided"
- "2 tbs vegetable oil"

recipeinstructions:
- "Place flour, seasoned salt, and pepper in a wide, shallow dish (like a pie plate). Stir to combine."
- "Heat a large deep sided sautée pan over medium high heat. Add vegetable oil and 2 tbs of the butter."
- "Lightly season both sides of each cube steak with salt and pepper. Dredge in flour to coat, gently tapping off excess so coating is nice and light."
- "When oil and butter are nice and hot place cube steaks in pan. Cook 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate. Set aside."
- "Add mushrooms to pan. Sprinkle with thyme. Cook until mushrooms begin to soften, stirring frequently. About 5 minutes."
- "Add remaining 2 tbs butter to pan. As soon as it melts stir in 4 tbs of the flour used to coat the cube steaks. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly."
- "Wisk in beef broth. Increase heat to medium high. Bring to a simmer until gravy thickens, wisking frequently."
- "As soon as gravy thickens return cube steaks to pan, turning to coat evenly with gravy. Reduce heat to low. Let rest 5 minutes for cube steaks to heat through and soak in some of that gravy."
- "Serve with mashed potatoes and a side salad to complete your tasty meal. Enjoy!"
- "Note: As always, taste for seasoning before serving. I usually give the mushrooms a light sprinkling of salt and pepper as they cook, but almost never add salt beyond that point. It&#39;s up to you to determine how you want it seasoned."
