- "6 oz fresh blueberries by weight"
- "2/3 cup granulated sugar"
- "3/4 cup whole milk"
- "1 1/2 cup heavy cream"
- "1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "pinch kosher salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine blueberries and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to medium heat. As it boils, use a potato masher to smash the blueberries as completely as possible."
- "Boil for about 10 minutes, smashing once in a while and keeping it stirred so the sugar doesn&#39;t burn."
- "Strain the blueberry mixture, discarding the solids and retaining the syrup. Be thorough to get as much syrup as possible, and be careful because this syrup is boiling hot and sticky, and it will stain anything it contacts."

- "Pour this mixture into an ice cream machine and follow it&#39;s instructions to finish the ice cream. Things work best if the mixture is chilled for a while beforehand. Be sure to freeze the finished product overnight and enjoy it the next day!"
