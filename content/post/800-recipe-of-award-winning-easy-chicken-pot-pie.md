<h3>Instructions to make Easy chicken pot pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Bake a 3-4lb chicken with potato wedges (season the chicken to tour tast)when it&#39;s done remove about 2 cups of meat and cube your potato wedges. I use a leftover roasted chicken because I like to get two meals out of it and my  pot pie recipe doesn&#39;t call for a whole chicken..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a bowl mix chicken ,spices, vegetables and herbs . Salt pepper to taste..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a saute pan melt your butter and mix your flour in with the melted butter. Add the broth until the gravy is as thick or thin as you like it ( I like a thick gravy so I use a little bit more flour). Salt and pepper your gravy to taste, then set it aside..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Put your pie crust on you pie dish, put your chicken and vegetables in it. Pour the warm gravy over the top. Scramble an egg in a  bowl and add a little  water. Brush the edge of the bottom pie crust with the egg then cover it with the top pie crust. Pinch edges together with a fork. Brush the whole top crust with egg then cut about 4 slices on the top of the crust.  Bake your pie at 400Â°F for 40 minutes or untill top crust is a golden Brown . After its done remove end let it for about 5 to 10 minutes and enjoy..
