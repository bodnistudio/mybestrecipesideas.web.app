Melt butter in a wide frying pan over low heat. Saute leeks until tender (about five minutes). Remove… The cashews create a creamy pasta sauce without adding any dairy! After the cashews have soaked, they get blended with some vegetable broth. I really like using broth instead of water because it adds a lot more flavor to the sauce.
