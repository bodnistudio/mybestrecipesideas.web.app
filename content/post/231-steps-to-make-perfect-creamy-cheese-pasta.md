Pick your favourite pasta, toss with an easy homemade meat sauce, add some fresh mozzarella cheese, grated parmesan and a little white sauce, then bake this easy baked pasta dish! This cream cheese pasta sauce relies on butter to help thin the cream cheese a little. It makes a thinner sauce that has a very rich and decedent flavor, reminiscent of CrÃ¨me Fraiche. In addition to work very well over chicken and broccoli ziti, try pouring this sauce on top of a good cut of steak bedded on top of white mashed sweet potatoes.
