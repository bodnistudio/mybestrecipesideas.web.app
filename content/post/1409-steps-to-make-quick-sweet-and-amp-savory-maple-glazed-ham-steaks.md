recipeingredient:
- "3-8 ounce ham steaks maple or brown sugar flavor are extra yummy"
- "1 cup packed brown sugar"
- "1 cup pure maple syrup NOT pancake syrup grade B if available"
- "1 tbsp yellow mustard"
- "1 tbsp spicy brown mustard"
- "1 tbsp white vinegar"
- "1 tbsp apple juice"
- "pinch each cinnamon and ginger optional"
- "1 tbsp butter for skillet"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium bowl, add all ingredients except ham and butter. Whisk well to combine. Pour into saucepan and warm over medium heat, stirring constantly until it thickens to a syrupy texture; about 10 minutes. Turn off heat and let sit."
- "Score edges of ham steaks about every 2 inches to prevent curling. Warm butter in skillet over medium heat, add ham steaks and fry about 2 1/2-3 minutes. You may need to cook steaks individually if they don&#39;t fit."
- "Flip over and spoon maple glaze onto steaks evenly. Fry for another 3 minutes or so, to desired doneness. Serve with mashed potatoes (see my recipe) and remaining maple glaze, if desired."
- "Note* the maple glaze keeps nicely in the fridge for a long time. If it hardens or gets grainy just microwave it for 20 seconds at a time until it reaches the proper consistency, but WATCH CLOSELY!!! I have had it boil over and it makes a HUGE mess! Enjoy!"
