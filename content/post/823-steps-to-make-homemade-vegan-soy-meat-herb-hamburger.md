Mouth watering vegan meatless meatballs; Stuffed into bell peppers oozing with a creamy vegan cheese sauce under the grill; This meaty but meatless vegan ground beef even works wonders as a quick snack on toast for lunch or breakfast. While a few ingredients here are optional but strongly recommended, there are a few you cannot do with out. Of course, it isn&#39;t exactly like lamb meat, I still have no idea how to mimic the fibrous meat texture in veggie roasts, though I get it very close in vegan pulled-pork and veggie burgers made with TSP. The texture is closer to ground meat, actually extremely similar to ground meat. Tempeh and TVP are excellent choices to mimic the texture of ground beef for burgers, meatloaves or Shepherd&#39;s pies.
