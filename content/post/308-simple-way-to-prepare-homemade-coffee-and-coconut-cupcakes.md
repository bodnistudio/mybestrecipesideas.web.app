Of all the cupcake recipes I&#39;ve shared on here (and there have been quite a few now!) this one has probably taken the longest to perfect. I had a very similar problem with this coffee sponge to the one I experienced with my chocolate cake, in that actually when you eat a lot of coffee cakes (and chocolate cakes), pretty much all the coffee flavour is coming from the buttercream and there&#39;s. Mix until smooth, then fold in the shredded coconut. Transfer to a wire rack and cool completely. Spread a generous amount of Coffee Buttercream Frosting on cooled cupcakes. 

So that's going to wrap this up with this special food coffee and coconut cupcakes recipe. Thanks so much for reading. I am confident you can make this at home.
