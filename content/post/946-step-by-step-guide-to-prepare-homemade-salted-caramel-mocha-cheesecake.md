It&#39;s sweetened with the creamer and some hot fudge and caramel sauce to punch up that caramel mocha flavor, plus I added some instant espresso powder. Inside those cute little jars, from the bottom up, is: chocolate graham cracker or cookie crust, mocha cheesecake, salted caramel, whipped cream, more salted caramel drizzled on top. It&#39;s a pretty decadent dessert, but the little jar gives you a small, satisfying portion. Run small metal spatula around edge of pan to loosen cheesecake. My obsession for mini cheesecakes knows no bounds.
