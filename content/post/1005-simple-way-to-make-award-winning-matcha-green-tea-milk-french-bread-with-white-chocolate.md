This isn&#39;t necessary, you can definitely just use plain milk (any milk will do) but I used it as an excuse to get rid of a green tea bag (which shocker, I&#39;m not a huge fan of drinking either). Matcha macarons has green tea infused into the shells making them extra flavorful. White chocolate ganache is sandwiched in between for a delicious Japanese-bakery-inspired flavor pairing. Matcha green tea macarons is one of the most popular macaron flavors and for good reason.
