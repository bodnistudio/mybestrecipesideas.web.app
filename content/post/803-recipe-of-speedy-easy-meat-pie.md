		A great recipe for leftover meat!
	
		First meat pie I ever made, and will be sure to make it many more times.
	
		I didn&#39;t have veg/beef soup on hand, substituted it with condensed cream of tomato soup.
	
		Added a little water and some peas.
	
		I cooked the potatoes and carrots by themselves and then added to mixture.
