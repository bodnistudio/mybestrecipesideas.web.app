recipeingredient:
- " Filling"
- "1 tube of sausage meat"
- "1/2 onion chopped"
- "3/4 cup breadcrumbs"
- "1 Apple"
- "2 square sheets of puff pastry"
- "1/2 cup milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 360°F."
- "Chop the onion finely and soften in a hot frying pan with a little oil, this will take 5 - 10 mins."
- "Remove the onion from the heat to cool completely. You can now prepare the rest of the filling. Peel and core the apple. Grate the apple into a large bowl. Add the pork sausage meat and breadcrumbs."
- "On a flat surface lay out the pastry sheets. Cut the squares in half length ways to make four rectangles."
- "Now the onion is cool, add into your large bowl with the meat. Mix with your hands until well combined."
- "Grab a handful of the sausage meat mix and roll in your hands to make a long slab, about four centimeters thick and as long as your pastry rectangle. Place the sausage meat slab in the middle of your rectangle. You&#39;ll want about 4-5 cm either side of pastry."
- "Use a pastry brush to paint the pastry around the meat with milk. Now wrap the bottom side of the pastry around the meat tightly, so there are no gaps. Then roll the other side over the meat so the pastry overlaps and pat down so it sticks. You should have one long sausage roll now."
- "Complete steps 5 and 6 until you have filled all of your pastry rectangles."
- "Now using a sharp knife, cut the larger rolls into smaller rolls. Mine are about 10 cm long each."
- "Score the top of each roll three times with the knife, and brush with the milk. This makes the pastry golden."
- "Place fold side down on a baking try and bake for 30 mins."
- "Remove from oven and let cool on try for 5 - 10 mins before serving. Enjoy!"
