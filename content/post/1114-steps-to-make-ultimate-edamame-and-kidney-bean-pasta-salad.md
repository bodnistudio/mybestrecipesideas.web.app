It goes so well with all the fresh veggies. Mix the corn, edamame, and black beans together with the pasta. Make the dressing by putting all the dressing ingredients in a blender (except the sesame seeds) and pulse until fully mixed. I&#39;m sitting at my table eating this right now for my lunch. I used green onions instead of regular for a milder flavor.
