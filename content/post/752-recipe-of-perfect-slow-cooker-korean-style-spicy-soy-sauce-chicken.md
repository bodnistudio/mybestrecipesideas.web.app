recipeingredient:
- "3 pounds bonein chicken pieces I think drums and thighs are best"
- "1/2 a medium onion cut into 1inch pieces"
- "2 large carrots peeled and cut into 1inch thick pieces"
- "1/2 a bell pepper cut into 1inch squared pieces"
- "1/4 cup soy sauce to start"
- "1/4 cup gochujang Korean red chili paste Sriracha is an imperfect but also delicious substitute"
- "3-5 Tablespoons sugar depending on how sweet you like your food"
- "1/2 cup dryish white wine or sake if youve got some laying around"
- "1/2 cup water if you dont have the wine then its 1 cup water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Dump everything into your slow cooker and, with your hands, give everything a gentle turn and massage so you mix and distribute your seasonings evenly. If you have up to an hour to let everything sit before turning on the slow cooker, great. That&#39;ll help the flavors absorb into the chicken."
- "Cook on low for 8 to 10 hours, high for 5 to 7, keeping in mind the note at the top of the recipe. An hour or two before eating is a good time to adjust the seasoning so the added flavors can absorb - more soy sauce if you want it saltier, a little more sugar if you&#39;d like it sweeter, more gochujang if you want it hotter (though the gochujang is also a salty flavoring element, so you might want to add some fresh or dried chilies if you want to increase heat without increasing the salt."
- "Because there is minimal liquid in the recipe to prevent a soupy flavor and texture, it would be ideal to be able to give everything a stir and redistribute the chicken at between 2 and 4 hours before eating so all parts of the chicken pieces can soak up the flavor. If you can&#39;t manage that because of your schedule, then doing it right when you get home and hopefully at least 30 minutes to an hour before you eat will help."
- "Enjoy with some steamed white rice or noodles of choice. :)"
