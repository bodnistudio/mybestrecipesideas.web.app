<h3>Instructions to make Shepherd&#39;s Pie (Vegetarian/Vegan /Low Carb):</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Preheat Oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Prepare vegetables as per ingredients instructions (pic doesn&#39;t show the Cauliflower once put in the food processor or the rice flour mixture).
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place 1tbs Olive oil in a pan, add the onion and saute for 5mins..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			While the onion sautes, in the other pan, add the processed Cauliflower, 2 cups almond milk, 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper to the other pan. Place lid on pan and leave to simmer covered (I didn&#39;t take any pics, sorry). This will cook down for approx 15 - 20mins cooking (or until softened).
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Back to the filling pan, Add the other tbs olive oil and then leek and garlic and saute for a further 3 minutes. Then add the Mushrooms, carrot, celery, parsley, tomato paste, thyme, mixed herbs, paprika, 2 tsp salt &amp; 1 tsp pepper and stir..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the lentils and 1 1/2 cups Water and stir. Bring to the boil, turn down to simmer for approx 10mins.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Just before the filling is ready, add the rice flour water mixture and cook for a minute or so and place the filling mixture into the baking tray.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			For the topping, place the cooked down Cauliflower mixture in a Food processor (I used a Nutribullet), with the butter and 2tbs Parmesan and blitz until smooth..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Spread the Cauliflower Mash over the top of the filling, sprinkle the last tablespoon of Parmesan over the top and bake for 30mins..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Once finished, serve. You can leave in the oven for longer for a browner top. I was too hungry to wait and it was great anyway (although doesn&#39;t make for the prettiest of pics ðŸ˜‚).
