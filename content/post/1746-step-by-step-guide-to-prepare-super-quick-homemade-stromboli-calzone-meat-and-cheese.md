Hey everyone, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, stromboli/calzone (meat and cheese). One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

They are nice and they look fantastic. Stromboli/calzone (meat and cheese) is something which I've loved my entire life.

Stromboli is a type of turnover filled with various Italian cheeses (typically mozzarella) and usually Italian cold cuts (typically Italian meats such as salami, capocollo and bresaola) or vegetables. The dough used is either Italian bread dough or pizza dough. Calzones use ricotta cheese, and stromboli does not.
