Served plain or dressed in tangy tomato sauce, comfort food never tasted so good. Roll each square into a ball. Remove and turn meatballs if browned already on bottom (use a thin metal spatula to scrape from baking sheet if needed). Come let us celebrate life with you. (Meatballs can be frozen for longer, but tend to develop freezer burn.) Thaw meatballs in the refrigerator overnight before cooking. Freezing cooked meatballs: Let the cooked meatballs cool completely, then arrange in a single layer on baking sheet and freeze until solid.
