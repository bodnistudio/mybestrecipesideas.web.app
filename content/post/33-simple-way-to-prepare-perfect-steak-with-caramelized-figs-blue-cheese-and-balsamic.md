I&#39;m obsessed with these figs stuffed with blue cheese wrapped in Prosciutto ham! Such a great way to enjoy figs as an appetizer or light lunch. Prosciutto and Figs pair well in salads raw, but when the figs cook, they caramelize and become even sweeter and more delicious. The reduced balsamic vinegar sauce gives the flank steak a unique flavor that pairs perfectly with the caramelized onions. Serve with steamed broccoli or asparagus, and drizzle some of the glaze over the vegetable.
