WHAT KIND OF MEAT FOR PHILLY CHEESE STEAK? Boneless Ribeye is the preferred cut of meat but it&#39;s usually super expensive. Sirloin works just as well and here is a little secret â€” a lot of the real cheesesteak joints actually use this or a blend of Sirloin and Ribeye. one thing I might do is make Philly cheese steak fries themselves. Which would include the meat and cheese in the fries.
