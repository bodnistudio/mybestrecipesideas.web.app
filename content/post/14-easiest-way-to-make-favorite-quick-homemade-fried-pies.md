<h3>Instructions to make Quick homemade fried pies:</h3>

		<li>
			Defrost as many frozen biscuits as you need, each one = 1 pie..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Flour each biscuit and then roll flat to about 1/4‚Äù thick with a rolling pin..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>

			This work with any canned pie filling, pudding, jelly, preserves, to make a sweet dessert or complete the same steps and fill with your choice of filling. I have done chicken fajita filling, pot roast, chili (Texas style) eggs and sausage, cheeseburger patty chunks, and literally anything that goes well with biscuits/biscuit dough. I prefer my homemade apple butter..

		Making mini apple pies is just kids&#39; play when you use refrigerated biscuits for the wrappers.
	
		Although these apple pies are baked in the oven rather than deep fried, the concept remains the same: fill delicious dough with apple pie filling and top with a dusting of cinnamon-sugar.
