Last weekend was really busy with family visiting and I wanted to make something quick for lunch as some of the family couldn&#39;t stay late. Roast it slightly with the side that you are going to use for adding toppings, facing the heat. (This means first roast the top side of pizza, then add toppings and then roast it from another side. But when I tried that with ready-made pizza-base, two things happened: first, the pizza base became crunchy like biscuit! and sencond, the toppings and cheese did not integrate properly with the base as in case of newly prepared pizza base. Do u, in general, suggest using ready-made pizza-base, or always preparing new. It&#39;s seen you through your best and worst times.
