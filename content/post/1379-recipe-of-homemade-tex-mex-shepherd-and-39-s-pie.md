This simple Shepherd&#39;s pie has a (very un-authentic) Mexican twist via the green chiles, chili powder, cumin, peppers, and corn. It was a favorite dish for my kids growing up, and I used to make it frequently. I love it because it gives the dish a little more flavour, and just a tiny bit of heat. After making my own version a few times and tweaking it up a little more each time I came up with what I&#39;m calling the Mexican Shepherd&#39;s Pie. This comfort dish takes advantage of a few shortcuts that don&#39;t lesson the flavor or quality of the meal, like refrigerated mashed potatoes and pico de gallo, so you can get dinner on the.
