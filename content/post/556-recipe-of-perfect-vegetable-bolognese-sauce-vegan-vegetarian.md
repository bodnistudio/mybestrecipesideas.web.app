As a vegetarian, I was tempted to keep the traditional parmesan cheese and milk in this sauce. If you consume dairy products, by all means swap these into the sauce for an awesome vegetarian bolognese sauce. Instead, I tried using nutritional yeast and oat milk. Beans stand in place of ground beef in this hearty vegetarian sauce that&#39;s ready when you are--thanks to the crock pot. The prep is quick and easy to do in the morning before heading off to work.
