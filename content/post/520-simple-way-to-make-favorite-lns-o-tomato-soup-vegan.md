Warm up with this rich and creamy vegan tomato soup. A thick tomato base mixed with cashew cream and topped with homemade croutons for a satisfying fall soup. After a long snowy walk, all bundled up in woolly mittens, scarves and hats and snow boots, both Brian and I were cold and hungry and craving something. I know it&#39;s summertime-not exactly the time of year that we think about cooking up a big pot of soup, much less eating it. But really, yesterday was a rainy ol&#39; day in the hills of Tennessee, and who can resist a comforting bowl of soup.
