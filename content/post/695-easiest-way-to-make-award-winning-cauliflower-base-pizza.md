recipeinstructions:
- "Blend your cauliflower until rice-like. Add the almond meal, chia seeds, oregano, chilli and water and blend until smooth(ish)."
- "Use a baking tray or pizza tray. Cover with non-stick baking paper and a light layer of vegetable oil. Pour over the blended cauliflower and smooth out with the back of a spoon. Thickness depends on how thick you like your pizza! I prefer a thinner base, which also cooks more quickly in the oven."
- "Bake at 180 degrees for approx 7 minutes, then remove from the oven and flip the base over.

- "Bake for another 5-7 minutes, until the base starts to crisp."
- "Now remove from the oven and add your tomato puree, chopped tomatoes and mozzarella cheese."
- "Return to the oven for a couple of minutes, until the cheese is beginning to melt. Then add your other toppings - I like chorizo (finely sliced), ham and pineapple. Spread these evening over your base and top with grated cheddar."
- "Return to the oven, but this time on grill setting. Grill until your toppings begin to crisp. Remove from the oven and ENJOY!"
