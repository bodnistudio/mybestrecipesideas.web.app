This is an adapted recipe from Allrecipes. This is a great recipe for those who don&#39;t like to have a browning step when they use a slow cooker. This recipe lets you coat your meat and place it on the bottom of your slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients on top. It then has you cook on high for an hour (to somewhat replicate the browning stage) and then. This pepper steak is our kids&#39; favorite and super easy in the slow cooker.
