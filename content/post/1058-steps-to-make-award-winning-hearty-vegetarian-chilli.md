recipeinstructions:
- "Heat up a large saucepan over a medium heat and add in a bit of oil to fry the onions. Add the onions and also the vinegar. Fry gently until they begin to soften. Add in the mince meat alternative and the tomato pureé paste, season well with salt and pepper. Stir to get it coated in the oil and fry for around two minutes."
- "Add in the water and the vegetable stock by crumbling it in. Stir gently then turn down the heat and bring to a simmer. Add in the cocoa powder, stir through until dissolved and the sauce turns a dark rich brown colour."
- "Add in the dried spices next, so the cumin, cinnamon, chilli powder and smoked paprika. I find it best to add in a bit of chilli powder first, taste it, then add more accordingly to your own personal preference. I like mine pretty hot so add 1tsp!"
- "Stir the spices through and then add in the chopped carrots. Place a lid over and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Once that time has elapsed, add in the tomatoes, courgette and pepper. Stir really well to get everything incorporated well then return to a simmer with a lid on. Simmer low and slow for 1 hour 30 to 2 hours. Cooking the chilli nice and slowly gives the sauce more depth of flavour."
- "At the end of cooking, dilute the cornflour with a tiny bit of cold water then pour it in and stir through to thicken up the sauce. Add in fresh chilli at the end to taste. Simmer for a few more minutes so the fresh chilli infuses with the sauce then remove from the heat. Season with more salt and pepper to taste."
- "Serve up with your choice of sides and enjoy! :)"
