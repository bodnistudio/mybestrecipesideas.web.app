- "1/4 cup coriander leaves chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pressure cook chopped potato cubes for 2 whistles with salt and turmeric powder and drain them. if you&#39;ve got time and can&#39;t stand the suspense of what&#39;s going on inside, you can watch them boil and cook to perfection in a pan instead. It doesn&#39;t have to those mathematical cubes. Just randomly chop an average sized potato into say- half, criss-cross twice and you are done. You can try the typical slanting style chop for ladies finger. It doesn&#39;t have to super thin mini circles."
- "On a non-stick pan, heat the vegetable oil. Once the oil is hot, splash the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and curry leaves. You can add dried red chillies too (just for some glam quotient). Once the seeds crackle, add the crushed garlic cloves and saute till the raw smell goes."
- "Into this, add chilli flakes, chopped red onions and ladies finger with salt and turmeric powder and give it a mix. Do NOT add water- you don&#39;t want the bhindi getting gooey. Cook this mixture on low flame with the lid closed for 3-4 minutes. You can go watch tv now, but remember to occasionally open, check and stir ; else you may have to call it smoked aloo bhindi :)"
- "Once the ladies finger is cooked, add the cooked potatoes and saute for 1-2 minutes together to give it a slight char."
- "Time to taste and balance out the flavors. Add additional salt and some pepper if your palate tells you to. Add the lime juice, amchoor kasuri methi and coriander leaves, give a final mix and serve hot. Goes with rice, rotis or any flat breads."
