I call it &#34;tzatziki&#34; but it does not have cucumbers in it so it technically is NOT tzatziki sauce. But it does have freshly squeezed lemon juice (like on those traditional Greek fries I mentioned above), lots of minced garlic, and of course, fresh herbs. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside oven fries. These Greek fries are baked in extra virgin olive oil and finished with flavors like garlic, oregano and feta. Add a side of homemade Tzatziki for dipping!
