recipeinstructions:
- "Put all the ingredients except for the butter in a heatproof bowl and mix well with a whisk. Microwave for one and a half minutes (at 500w)."
- "Change to a rubber spatula and mix the contents of the bowl again, then microwave for another minute. If needed, mix and microwave again for another 30 seconds. Mix up very well each time. The contents of the bowl should come together as one sticky mass."
- "Add the butter and mix and knead it in. The mixture separates when you add the butter, but keep kneading it patiently with the spatula and it will come together again."
- "When it reaches an easy to handle, shiny pasty texture, it&#39;s done. Take the paste out onto a sheet of plastic wrap, and cover with piece of plastic."
- "Use a rolling pin or spatula to spread the paste out so it&#39;s about 16 cm square. Store in the freezer."
- "When you are ready to use a flavor sheet, use it at the partially defrosted stage. If you make it the same day you&#39;re baking the bread you&#39;re using it in, make the flavor sheet while the dough is in the middle of its 1st rising, put the sheet in the freezer, and then take it out when you are ready to fold it in, and it will has just the right texture."
- "This photo shows the butter-addition stage of making a coffee flavor sheet. The paste separates at first, but as you keep kneading and cutting in the butter, it comes together into one mass."
- "If using tea: 1 tea bag contains 2 g of tea leaves, so put 3 tea bags into a bit more than 100 g of milk, bring to a boil, then turn off the heat, cover with a lid, and let the tea brew for 3 minutes. Earl Grey tea is the best."
- "After brewing the tea, measure out 100g of liquid. The tea should be as strong as shown in the photo. It will have the color of coffee milk. Mix this liquid together with the dry ingredients."
- "For jams, bring the water to be added to a boil, dissolve the jam in it, and add the floury ingredients."
