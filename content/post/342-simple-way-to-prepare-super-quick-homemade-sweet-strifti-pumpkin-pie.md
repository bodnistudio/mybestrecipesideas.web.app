<h3>Instructions to make Sweet strifti pumpkin pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Prepare the dough and set it aside to rest so that the filo sheets will roll out nice and easy..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			While the dough rests, prepare the filling. Place the grated pumpkin and the sugar in a pot over moderate heat, so that the pumpkin will let out its liquids..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the rest of the ingredients and mix a little until the liquids are absorbed so that the filling is not runny..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Take balls from your dough and roll them out..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cut the filo sheet into 3 strips. Each strip will be a strifti (spiral) mini pumpkin pie (check out the tips)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add filling into each strip of your filo sheet..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Roll the strip with the filling inside and then make it into a spiral, to form a snail..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place in a baking tray lined with vegetable oil. Brush each mini pie with a little oil and bake for about 30 minutes at 200°C..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>

		If you have the time using fresh roasted puree is going to improve the filling.
	
		The filling is quick and easy to make, and all you need to do is mix all the ingredients together.
	
		Make sure to add the filling to the crust while it&#39;s still warm.
	
		I do more sweet potato pies than pumpkin and I don&#39;t want to have to buy one heavy cream for one singular pie.
	
		Many pumpkin pie recipes call for evaporated milk and I often get asked if you can substitute sweetened condensed milk for evaporated milk in the MyÂ Pumpkin Pie with Sweetened Condensed Milk just might be the easiest pumpkin pie that you can make.
