No other dessert has wowed family and friends the way this stunning crepe cake did the first time I made it. A showstopper in every sense of the word, it features layers of tender chocolate crepes and rich white chocolate buttercream frosting draped in a semisweet chocolate ganache. I used &#34;World Table Chocolate Cookie Thins&#34; found at Wal-Mart and they worked perfectly. I also plan to experiment with different flavored World Table cookies (lemon chocolate mint and chocolate caramel) and different extracts in the whipping cream like almond peppermint and lemon.
