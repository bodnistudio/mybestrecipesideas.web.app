##### Steps to make Steak fajitas:

1. You can do this two ways - thinly slice your flank steak or leave whole. I like to slice it- it marinates better and it cooks faster.
1. Mix the marinade ingredients- the olive oil through the cilantro.

1. Let marinade for one hour ( you may marinade longer if you choose but an hour will do the trick)
1. Now get a grill screaming hot. Using a grill pan or grill wok, place on grill for a few minutes to get that hot. Add the veggies and quickly stir fry for about 2 minutes. Then throw that meat on top and continue stirring and shaking that pan. Cook about another five minutes or meat is desired doneness. Trust me.. you&#39;ll want it pink to red though.
1. If cooking a whole flank steak, cook veggies as directed and cook the steak whole on grill grates for about 2-3 minutes on both sides. Flank steak is thin so don&#39;t overcook! ( I&#39;m so terrified of overcooking beef!) Remember! Grill needs to be hot!
