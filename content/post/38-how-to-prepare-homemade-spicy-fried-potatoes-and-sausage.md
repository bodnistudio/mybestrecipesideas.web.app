Turn the potatoes every few minutes till they are browned on all sides. Slice the smoked sausage (I use the skinless with cheese inside) and add to the pan. Cover then stir every few minutes. We like the meat really browned so I turn up the heat to high till the sausage slices are the right color. Place potatoes slices on a baking sheet, spreading out as much as possible.
