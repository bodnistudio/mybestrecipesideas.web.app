recipeingredient:
- " to 4 cup White uncooked rice"
- " Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Gently rinse the white rice in a colander or sieve so that the rice doesn&#39;t soak in the water and absorb any of the cloudy water. Let the drained sit in the colander for 1 hour."
- "Once the water has been thoroughly drained from the rice in Step 1, put it into the Staub pot and add the water. *If the rice was left to sit for 1 hour it will soak up the water very nicely."
- "You&#39;ve now completed all the preliminaries to cook delicious rice. Place the pot on the stove after the rice has been soaked for an hour, and set the heat to medium."
- "Medium heat as specified in Step 3 should be strong enough so that the flames touch the bottom of the pot. The photo shows a round 16cm Staube cocotte with 1.5 rice cooker cups of rice."
- "Once the water in the pot begins to bubble at the bottom, and the center becomes cloudy, raise the heat to high."
- "The flames should never be so strong that they escape around the edges of the pot."
- "Turning the heat up to high in Step 5 will get the edges of the water to start boiling. The center will become even more cloudy."
- "Once big bubbles start forming, it&#39;s almost done."
- "When even more big bubbles start forming, cover the pot with a lid. Set a timer to 1 minute."
- "Occasionally some soapy bubbles may escape from underneath the lid (once or twice), but don&#39;t worry about it. *The photo shows the marks left by the sticky bubbles."
- "After 1 minute is up, turn down the heat to low (turn the burner knob to the lowest setting). Set the timer for 9 minutes."
- "After 9 minutes has passed, turn off the heat. Don&#39;t remove the lid and let it steam for 12 minutes. *Absolutely do not open the lid."
- "After 12 minutes have passed, the delicious rice is cooked It&#39;s difficult to tell from the photo, but there are small spaces in between the rice grains and the grains are standing up."
- "Do not leave the rice as-is! Fluff it up gently using a cutting motion."
- "Ahhh. It&#39;s so delicious You will look forward to eating rice everyday I think the best thing about buying a Staub cocotte is that it makes delicious rice."
- "Steps 1 and 2 are completely necessary, but sadly they take a lot of time to complete. I usually prepare it before going to bed or before I go out for the day, and let it sit in the refrigerator."
- "If the rice hasn&#39;t soaked or absorbed enough water, it will taste completely different. Try to complete both the soaking and absorbing steps within 24 hours."
- "It&#39;s usually said that &#34;too big is better than too small&#34; but try to match the amount of rice to the size of the Staub pot. The rice will taste different if the pot is too big or too small."
- "1.5 rice cooker cups of rice is just right for the 2 of us, so I usually make both plain white rice and rice cooked with other ingredients using the 16 cm diameter Staub Round Cocotte."
- "I usually use the16cm cocotte for 1-1.5 rice cooker cups of rice, the 20cm for 2-2.5 cups of rice, and the 22cm for 3-4 cups of rice."
- "But you can also use a 10cm Staub to make 0.4 cups of rice. There are many different sizes you can have fun with."
- "[If using a 10cm round Staub...] In Step 8, cover with a lid and turn the heat to low. Set the timer to 9 minutes."
- "Once the 9 minutes has passed, turn off the heat. Leave the lid on and let it steam for 10 minutes. *Absolutely do not remove the lid."
- "After 10 minutes, gently fluff up the rice taking care not to crush the grains, and it&#39;s done If you don&#39;t have a small rice paddle, you can use a small general purpose spatula."
