- "300 grams Cooked rice warm"
- "1 and 12 tablespoons Sushi vinegar"
- "1 tbsp Toasted white sesame seeds"
- "5 leaves Shiso leaves"
- "1 to 2 drops for each Lemon juice optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the shiso leaves. Cut out heart shapes of a 2-cm-length in the middle using a pair of scissors. When you do this fold the shiso leaves in half first and cut out half-heart-shapes to make symmetric hearts."
- "Make 10 heart shapes. Julienne the leftover shiso leaves and pat dry well with kitchen paper. (If the leaves are moist it makes lumps when they are mixed with the rice.)"
- "Drizzle sushi vinegar over the rice . Stir the rice using a cutting motion. After the rice is cooled, add the shiso leaves and sesame seeds."
- "Place about 30 g of the sushi rice onto cling film and squeeze the cling film to make balls. (You can make 10 to 12 of them.)"
- "After making rice balls place the heart-shaped shiso leaves and prosciutto on top. Shape them into balls using cling film. Leave to sit for at least 10 minutes so that the sushi rice and prosciutto settle."
- "I folded the crab sticks in half and made slits on the ends. I used them to decorate the dish with daikon radish sprouts in this picture. Sprinkle with lemon juice to your liking."
- "You don&#39;t have to use top-quality prosciutto. I used a slightly cheaper one, like in the picture."
