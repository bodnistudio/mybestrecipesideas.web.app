##### Steps to make Macrobiotic Stick Cookies:

In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk the sugars, olive oil, and almond milk until incorporated. Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture, and then stir with a wooden spoon until combined. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside. Both under-ripe and very ripe mashed bananas can be used in vegan baking: ripe bananas add lots of moistness and bind the ingredients very well while adding a distinctive hint of banana flavor (see my Banana Nut Bread recipe), and under-ripe bananas can be used for those baked goods that you don&#39;t want to taste like bananas.
