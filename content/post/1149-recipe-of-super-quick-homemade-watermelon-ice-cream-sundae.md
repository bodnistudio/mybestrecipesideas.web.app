- "1 watermelon my kids got from the garden was picked a day or two early, no big, perfect for a sorbet. Strip that melon naked, cut it into slices and remove those seeds...."
- "I prop my cutting board so the juice can drain into a large dish instead of being wasted all over my counter top and shirt."
- "After you get a majority of the seeds out put the pulp in a blender or food processor. The BEST tool is a blender, I errored and used a food processor. It&#39;s probably possible to successfully process watermelon but it was outside my skill set today. Don&#39;t forget to add the juice you collected while chasing those seeds around. There is a very sticky puddle of watermelon juice behind my second pic that you can&#39;t see :( Use a blender..."
- "Once I mopped up my counter, I poured the watermelon and simple syrup into a freezer safe container. Then I very precisely added lime juice, I actually just dumped some in tasted and added until it was where I wanted it... I&#39;d say about 2 Tbsp. but go with what you like..."
- "Then I put the container in the refrigerator, because sometimes I do things that do not make sense. At least it wasn&#39;t putting milk in the pantry, not that I have ever done that..."
- "Sometime later I realized my rushed mistake and with fingers crossed put the container in the freezer, that freezes stuff, right. An hour before dinner and hot from the summer heat I confirmed that my sorbet would not be dessert this evening...."
- "Motherhood and cooking are big on improvisation.... I decided to make watermelon ice cream sundaes... Equal amounts of vanilla ice cream, and water melon slush, Redi Wip, chocolate syrup. It was stupid good. But melts fast, so move it people! :)"
