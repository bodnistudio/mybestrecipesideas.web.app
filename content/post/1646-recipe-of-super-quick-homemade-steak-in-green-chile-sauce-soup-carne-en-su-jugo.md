recipeingredient:
- "4 each Green tomatoes"
- "3 each Chile Serrano finger peppers"
- "1/2 each White onion"
- "1 bunch Cilantro"
- "2 lb Steak cut into bite sizes"
- "1 packages Thick cut bacon"
- "3 tbsp Knorr beef seasoning see picture bellow"
- "2 can Beef broth"
- "1 1/2 cup Warm water"
- "2 cup Rice cooked"
- "2 cup Beans cooked"
recipeinstructions:
- "Begin by slicing bacon into bite size pieces. Cook on medium heat for approximately 3 minutes. Add steak pieces and beef seasoning. Mix with bacon and cook on medium heat. NOTE: any type of steak can be used. I personally buy the steak that is already cut into bite size pieces. I use all the bacon but if you choose, you may use less."
- "Meanwhile, cut all vegetables into smaller pieces and boil them in the water and beef broth for approximately 5-10 minutes."
- "When vegetables have been boiled, remove from stove and blend in batches. Strain blended vegetables into meat mixture. Reduce heat and simmer until meat is tender (about 30 mnts). NOTE: if the meat mixture has too much oil from the bacon, feel free to drain the fat."
- "The consistency should be soup like and the color should be greenish."
- "Separately, warm up the can of beans and rice. Leftover rice and beans work great. If you don&#39;t have any on hand then canned beans and microwaveable rice is a good option."
- "Serve soup with beans and rice. Garnish with onion and cilantro. Tortillas go very well with this dish. Enjoy!"
