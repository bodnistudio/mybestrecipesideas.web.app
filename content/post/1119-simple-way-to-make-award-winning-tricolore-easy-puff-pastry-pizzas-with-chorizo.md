recipeingredient:
- " Ready rolled puff pastry"
- " Passata or bolognese sauce or similar red sauce"
- " Chorizo cut into cubes"
- " Fresh mozzarella cut into slices so it can be broken apart easily"
- " Fresh basil"
- " Cherry tomatoes halved"
- " Chilli flakes"
- " Salt"
- " Pepper"
- " Olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare: Gather your ingredients (see photo). Set oven to 220C (fan assisted). Pop in your stone pizza base if you have one (optional)."
- "Spread one sheet of ready rolled puff pastry. Cut it into two rectangles, each approx 25cm by 30cm. These are the bases for your two pizzas! Score a line along the edges, about 1cm from the edge. This will become the crust."
- "Spread a thin layer of the sauce on each base. Be sure to keep the sauce, and all toppings, within the scored rectangle."
- "Add the other toppings to the two bases: Tear bits of the mozzarella and distribute them. Distribute the cherry tomatoes. Distribute the chorizo bits. Sprinkle with chilli flakes. Add some fresh ground pepper. Finally add some fresh basil on top."
- "Pop one of the pizzas in the oven to bake. Duration is tricky and really depends on your oven. A minimum of 5 mins is likely, but you&#39;ll need to keep a careful eye after this to make sure the crusts don&#39;t start to burn. For our two, it took about 6 mins and 7 mins."
