recipeingredient:
- "1 small onion"
- "1 medium carrot"
- "4-5 medium size potatoes"
- "1 sweet pepper"
- "1 jar pickled grated beetroots 500g"
- "1 tin red kidney beans in water"
- "3 tbsp salt"
- "2 tbsp sunflower oil"
- "1-2 garlic clove"
- " ground black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start with frying onions and carrots in the multicooker: peel an onion and cube it. Grease the pan with sunflower oil and fry onions for 5-7mins at 115¬∞C. Meanwhile, peel the carrot and shred it"
- "When onions become translucent - add the shredded carrots there and fry for 5-7 more minutes. Tbh, I don‚Äôt know why I fry onions and carrots gradually like this, I am not sure if it affects the final result when they are fried together from the beginning ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
- "To not loose the time while carrots and onions are being fried- peel and cube the potatoes. Also, to speed up the next step - heat 2L of water separately (I am using a kettle for this)"
- "After frying is ready, throw potatoes into the multicooker and fill it with 1.5L of the boiled water. Don‚Äôt fill it to the maximum, since there are still a few ingredients to add and it may overflow when boils. Set temperature to 110¬∞C and boil for 20 minutes. Usually I add salt at this point"
- "Now you have 20 minutes and 0,5L of boiling water left, so go ahead and make some tea, and prepare to the last steps"
- "I hope it was a nice tea break. Now go back to the cooking - cube the pepper, drain the beans and slice the garlic (Later I‚Äôve figured out that it‚Äôs better to start boiling beans earlier, together with potatoes, otherwise they might be too firm). Throw it all with the beetroots into the multicooker and boil for 10 more minutes at 105¬∞C. Also, now you can add more water to reach 3 full liters if needed NB: watch out the hot water splashes!"
- "I strongly recommend to leave it closed for 30-60 minutes more, so vegetables may soak with each other juices. Now it‚Äôs ready to be served. I personally prefer it with sour cream and garlic rye bread üòã enjoy!"
