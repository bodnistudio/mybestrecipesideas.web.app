I really want to get some more okara recipes out there since it&#39;s such a nutritious thing to waste (for those who make their own soy milk, you can probably relate with the guilt felt when throwing yet another batch in the bin). Okara is straight, mashed up soy pulp - no Nigari or magnesium chloride (coagulant used to make Tofu), no sodium phosphate or any other preservatives. So it goes bad fast, though can last in the freezer for a month. I improvised on this veggie burger recipe at a friend&#39;s house and made up stuff as I went along. I tried using okara in these.
