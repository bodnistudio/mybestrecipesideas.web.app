- "Preheat oven to 400째F."
- "Thinly slice the potatoes (the thinner the better) and place in a sealable container or bag. Set aside."

- "Remove and flip then return to the oven for another 10-13 minutes until lightly browned and crispy."
- "Alternatively set oven to broil and place as close to the top element as possible (instead of flipping the chips). Monitor closely until lightly browned and crispy (about 5 minutes. Will depend on thickness of potatoes)."
- "Remove from tray and serve with desired salads and meat. (Great to spruce up a hot dog or hamburger lunch)."
