Sprinkle both sides of beef with flour, salt and pepper. Likewise, you can transform any so-so steak into an incredible steak dinner by knowing how to prepare, cook, and garnish it.

Set out the beef in the slow cooker on warm, along with tortillas, bowls of shredded cheese, salsa, sour cream, and chopped lettuce, jalapenos, onions and tomatoes.
