I also decreased the amount of broth by half and the steam eggs were perfectly creamy and soft. Be sure to cook it gently over medium low heat. To thin the eggs and enhance the flavor, I usually use anchovy broth. You can certainly use water or any other broth such as dashima broth or vegetable broth. For the seasoning, salted shrimp (saeujeot, 새우젓) is the best with eggs.
