Sausage: You can buy in bulk from the meat counter at the grocery store, you can buy links and remove them from the casing, or you can make your own homemade breakfast sausage from ground pork and seasonings.; Keep it warm: You&#39;ll want to serve the gravy hot. Because it&#39;s a cream based gravy with a fair amount of fat, it will get thicker as it cools. To keep warm, just heat over low heat on the.
