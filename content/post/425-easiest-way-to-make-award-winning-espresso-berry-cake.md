I bake frequently and I made this chocolate espresso cake (two layer) for a co-worker&#39;s birthday who requested espresso cake with Bailey&#39;s buttercream. I used Hershey&#39;s special dark cocoa, and a couple of teaspoons of instant espresso in a cup of hot water as the brewed coffee-it might could take a little more to ramp up the coffee flavor. This moist, tender blueberry coffee cake scored high in our Test Kitchens, where tasters unanimously considered it a delicious way to use the first blueberries of the season. Studded with plump, juicy berries, the cake also features a sprinkling of turbinado sugar on top that adds another dimension of texture.

Slowly add the beaten eggs to the mixer, on a low-speed setting, a bit at a time. If the mixture starts to curdle or split, add a spoonful of your sieved flour, keep on adding the eggs, and a bit of flour if necessary until all the eggs are added. The few crumbs left on plates gave that away. One of the ingredients that really made this cake recipe come to life, in my opinion, was the addition of espresso powder in both the chocolate cake and in the chocolate frosting. If you&#39;ve not tried a bit of espresso when baking with chocolate, you really should.
