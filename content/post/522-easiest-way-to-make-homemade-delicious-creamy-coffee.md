##### The ingredients needed to make Delicious creamy coffee:

1. Prepare 1 tbsp Nescafe coffee (grounded is preferable)
1. Take 2 tbsp sugar
1. Take 2 tsp cold milk/room temperature
1. Take 2 cups milk
1. Prepare  For garnishing Cocoa powder or cinnamon (optional)


And when it&#39;s very hot, don&#39;t give me an ordinary coffee, I want an ice coffee. Let cool completely and stir in vanilla extract; set aside. If you don&#39;t like to drink your coffee black, you might add a splash of milk, half-and-half or heavy cream and a spoonful of sugar or sweetener. With creamer, you kill two birds with one stone because it&#39;s creamy and, most of the time, it&#39;s sweetened, so you don&#39;t need to add extra sugar.
