A green smoothie can taste just as good as a regular smoothie, yet the health results are MUCH better for you. It took a while to get into the green smoothie trend. We much preferred a sweet tasting berry burst, but this delicious glass of green goodness is divine. The pineapple chunks add a delicious sweet taste to the drink so it doesn&#39;t taste as bitter as other green smoothies.
