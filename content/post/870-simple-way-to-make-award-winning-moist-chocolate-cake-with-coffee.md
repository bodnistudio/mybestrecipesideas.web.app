This is the EASIEST dark chocolate cake yet. It is super-chocolaty and very moist. Dense, fudgy coffee chocolate cake with rich, dark chocolate and coffee frosting topped with a mountain of chocolate malt balls. You might be all chocolated (yep, that&#39;s a word now) out now but I&#39;m taking my chances because this cake, this glorious, four-tiered cake sandwiched with fudgy, coffee-flavoured chocolate frosting, is the most chocolatiest of chocolatey cakes.
