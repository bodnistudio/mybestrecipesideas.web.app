This is our favourite beef stew recipe. They broth is so incredibly flavourful. It should be noted that the broth is very light and not thick as it is in gravy-type stews, but I still love it. I usually make it without olives (my husband doesn&#39;t like them), and I often add potatoes when we plan to eat it without bread. We are in the middle of a pandemic, so I wanted to make comfort food for my family.
