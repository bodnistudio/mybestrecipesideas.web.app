This is very much like crockpot pizza. I prefer sprial noodles instead of egg noodles for the crockpot they hold better. For a no crust pizza option, my absolute favorite is this easy keto low carb pizza casserole recipe. If you&#39;re more into a traditional everything pizza, you might prefer my crustless pizza recipe in a cast iron skillet - it uses sausage and veggies as the base instead of the cauliflower you&#39;ll find in this pizza casserole. When you&#39;re looking for a surefire crowd-pleaser for a kids&#39; party, it&#39;s hard to go wrong with pizza. 

So that's going to wrap this up for this special food easy cheesy pizza casserole recipe. Thank you very much for your time. I'm confident you can make this at home.
