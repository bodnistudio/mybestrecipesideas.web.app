Sometimes, I use Chinese tea for cooking. I got a can of Tieguanyin (鐵觀音茶) from a friend that is perfect to make some tea eggs, my long-time favourite snack. When cool enough to handle, gently crack the egg&#39;s shell all over without removing the shell. Place back in the pan, cover the eggs with water, add the remaining ingredients and bring back to boil, turn down and simmer on low heat for an hour or more, this helps the flavours infuse the egg. Tea eggs made of eggs, tea and spices.
