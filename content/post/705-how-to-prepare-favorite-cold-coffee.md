Hey everyone, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, cold coffee. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Cold coffee is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It's enjoyed by millions every day. It's simple, it's fast, it tastes yummy. Cold coffee is something which I have loved my whole life. They're nice and they look fantastic.

How to Serve Cold Brewed Coffee. Cold brewed coffee can be served iced or piping hot, dealer&#39;s choice. You follow the same method for making the coffee either way, and then either serve it over ice or warm it up in the microwave for a hot cup.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook cold coffee using 5 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Cold coffee:

1. Make ready  cold milk
1. Make ready  coffee powder
1. Prepare  sugar
1. Get  Ice cubes
1. Take  Vanilla ice Cream


Leave room for cream and sugar if you take it that way. Add any additional ingredients you like in your coffee (simple syrup is a great way to sweeten up iced coffee), and stir. I prefer SilkÂ® Coconut Milk Beverage and I like to sweeten it with stevia.&#34; The iced coffee isn&#39;t as cold as it could (or should) be. The finished glass of iced coffee should be frigid, not sorta cold with half-melted ice cubes floating around.

Given the previous set of facts, one would assume that the logical solution would be to brew hot coffee, then transfer the brew to the fridge, allow it to cool, and use it to. Iced coffee is a type of coffee beverage served chilled, brewed variously with the fundamental division being cold brew - brewing the coffee cold, yielding a different flavor, and not requiring cooling - or brewing normally (hot) and then cooling, generally by simply pouring over ice or into ice cold milk. In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring are often mixed into the hot coffee before. Brewing your cold brew coffee in a French press makes the process easier, as it comes with a built-in plunger to filter the coffee once it&#39;s finished brewing. If you don&#39;t have a French press, use a large cup or mason jar, straining the coffee with a coffee filter or a sieve.
