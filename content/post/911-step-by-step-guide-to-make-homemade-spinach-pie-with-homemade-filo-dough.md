<h3>Steps to make Spinach Pie with Homemade Filo Dough:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			We prepare the phyllo dough. In a baking tray we add the flour and we make a well in the center. We pour in the vinegar and we start mixing the dough with our hands adding the water in little bits..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			After mixing for a while, the dough should become a smooth, elastic, plastic ball..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			We divide the dough into 8 pieces, we cover them with s clean towel, and we let them rest..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			We prepare the filling of the spinach pie. In a big mixing bowl we strain the spinach to remove any excess liquid. We mix in the spring onions, the dill, the spearmint, the olive oil, the feta cheese, the egg, and the yoghurt and we season with salt and pepper..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			We pick up 4 out of 8 dough pieces and we roll each one of them into a 20 cm diameter phyllo dough sheet. We end up with 4 phyllo dough sheets..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			We place the first phyllo dough sheet on our working surface and we spread on top olive oil mixed with butter. Then we place on top the second sheet and spread again on top olive oil mixed with butter. We repeat with the third and fourth sheet..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			We press gently the sheets with the roller..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			We roll all the four sheets into one single phyllo dough sheet..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			We start the pie by laying the phyllo dough sheet in a baking tray. We brush it with olive oil and we add the filling. We repeat the procedure with the other 4 dough pieces to make a second phyllo dough sheet and we add it on top of the filling..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			We preheat the oven to 180°C. We brush the second phyllo dough sheet with olive oil and we score the top with a knife. Finally we sprinkle sesame seeds on top and we bake the spinach pie in the oven..
