Just like pizza, this dip is best-served piping hot for all that stringy cheese action. Add a hot, cheesy dip to your party spread and it&#39;s guaranteed to be a total hit. Make a cheesy dip layered with marinara and three kinds of cheese that tastes just like pizza (bonus points if you serve it with garlic bread!), and be prepared for everyone to be talking about it for months. Crock Pot Hot Pizza Dip Notes: This recipe calls for pepperoni, onion and olives but much like pizza, feel free to substitute your favorite pizza toppings. Try alternative versions like Hawaiian (pineapple and ham) or BBQ Chicken and Bacon.
