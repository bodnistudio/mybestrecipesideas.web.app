This coconut banana keto smoothie recipe with almond milk is creamy, refreshing, healthy and just plain delicious! A lot of us on keto diets love the idea of a keto smoothie for breakfast, but would a coconut banana smoothie be good? Used dairy-free Silk Pure Coconut milk (was in the fridge I like it on cereal) and low-fat vanilla frozen yogurt. The result was a smoothie that was lower in fat and calories but at no sacrifice to flavor.

Add the coconut yogurt and milk to a high-speed blender then add the turmeric, fresh ginger and baobab powder (if using). Tip in the remaining ingredients then blend until smooth. Add ice and blitz again if you prefer a colder drink. Select the ripen banana, as these are sweeter and gives a perfect velvety texture to the banana coconut smoothie. The banana that has green shades of color, will not give a creamy texture and has lesser sweetness.
