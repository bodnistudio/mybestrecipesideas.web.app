Chocolate and peanut butter, always a match made in heaven, come together in the most delicious way in this rich homemade triple chocolate peanut butter ice cream. My love of the chocolate-peanut butter combination continues to grow every day and this took it to a new level. I&#39;ll admit I was a bit worried that the peanut butter flavor would be too strong, but the mousse is lightened up nicely with the whipped cream so the filling is rich and silky. A three-layer cake filled with crunchy bites of peanuts and graham cracker crumbs is smothered in a rich and creamy chocolate-peanut butter frosting that is finger-licking good.

I used Matzo meal in this chocolate torte and topped it with a peanut butter buttercream icing. She&#39;d had a lavish soiree at D&#39;Amico Kitchen and phenomenal cupcakes from my favorite Minneapolis bakery, The Salty Tart. The ice cream is ready to serve as soon as the ice cream maker stops! Stir hot chocolate/milk mixture into eggs. Just before adding to ice cream maker, stir a cup of ice cream mixture into peanut butter.
