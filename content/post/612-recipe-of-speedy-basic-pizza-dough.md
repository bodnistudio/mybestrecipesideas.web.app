recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the yeast and sugar into the lukewarm water. Then wait 5 mins before using the liquid to see if the yeast is working – little bits will start to rise to the top and you’ll know it’s active."
- "Put the flour and salt in the bowl and mix with the water prepared in 1st step. Knead for 5-7 mins until the dough is shiny and it springs back when you press your finger into it."
- "Cover tightly with cling film and then a tea towel. Place in a draught-free area that’s warm and leave until the dough has doubled in size. If it’s a hot day, it should only take 2 hrs to rise, but it could take 4 hrs if it’s cold. (If you don’t plan to use the dough for a day or two, place it in the fridge straight away; take it out 3-4 hrs before using. Punch it down first and bring it together on a floured surface.)"
- "Divide the dough into 4 pieces for plate-sized ones, then shape into balls. Then use your fingers to gently stretch the dough out."
- "Heat the oil in a saucepan over a low heat. Fry gently for 5 mins or until the tomatoes have softened. Bring to the boil and lower the heat. Simmer, uncovered, until thickened and reduced. Season."
- "Preheat the oven to 270C. Spread tomato sauce then topping any ingredients you would like to eat. Then slightly add some olive oil and black pepper. Put it in the oven for 5-7 mins. Then enjoy it!"
