Wash the leaves under running water, and keep the leaves in water until you want to wrap the zongzi."

It is the only type of rice suitable for making rice dumplings.  there are two kind of glutinous rice, the short grain and long one (see the picture)  If you use the long glutinous rice, then needs to soak it in water at least 4 hours.  the short one doesn&#39;t need to soak in water.

- "【 the filling 3 】  Salted duck egg yolk  Taiwanese zongzi often includes the salted egg yolk for its unique flavor.   Try to get it at the Asian grocery shop. if you couldn&#39;t find it, then simply use stewed eggs instead that would be ok too."
