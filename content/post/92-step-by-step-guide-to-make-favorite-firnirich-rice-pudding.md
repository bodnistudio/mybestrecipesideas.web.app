You basically cook the coarsely powdered long grained like basmati in milk and sugar. The rice gets cooked and also thickens the milk, yielding a creamy and rich texture. Firni is very much like kheer (rice pudding) where you cook rice with milk reducing it to a creamy rich texture. Only in this a thick paste of ground rice and cashews is used instead of whole rice. Sugar is used as a sweetener and saffron and/or crushed cardamom seeds are used for aroma.
