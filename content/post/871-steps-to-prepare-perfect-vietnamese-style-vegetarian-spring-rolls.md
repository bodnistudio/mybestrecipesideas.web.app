recipeinstructions:
- "PREPARE THE VEGETABLE FILLING: Wash and clean cilantro and mint leaves well. Pick the mint leaves off the stems; discard the stems. Roughly chop cilantro. Peel and cut carrots into fine juliennes or matchsticks. Cut cucumbers into matchsticks (I did not peel them as the green colour of the skin adds to the texture and colour of the rolls). Cut red bell pepper into thin long strips. If you like, you can sprinkle salt and pepper on the carrots, cucumbers and bell peppers and mix gently."
- "TO MAKE THE TOFU/PANEER STUFFING: Mix tofu/paneer strips with soy sauce, chilli flakes and salt to taste(if adding). Marinate for about 10 to 15 minutes."
- "In a small nonstick saucepan, heat 1 to 2 teaspoons of oil. Add marinated tofu/paneer. Stir fry on high heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Take care not to break the tofu/paneer strips. Remove from heat and let cool."
- "TO MAKE THE PEANUT DIPPING SAUCE: In a small bowl, mix peanut butter, soy sauce, chilli sauce/sriracha sauce along with the lemon/lime juice. Adjust the chilli sauce and lime juice to suit your taste. Whisk in 2 to 3 tablespoons of warm water until you get the desired consistency of dipping. Garnish with crushed peanuts. Keep aside. If you want, you can use ketchup too for dipping."
- "TO ASSEMBLE THE ROLLS: Work with one rice paper at a time. Soften the rice paper sheet according to the instructions on the packet.(The rice paper I used just needed to be dipped in water for about 20 to 25 seconds, and then placed on a towel to drain excess water). You want them soft but still firm and pliable. Place the wet sheet on a flat plate or cutting board Gently place few strips of carrots, bell pepper, cucumbers, a small tablespoon of cilantro and some mint leaves in the center"
- "Now, the bring sides over to the center over the filling."
- "Next, starting from the bottom, bring up and start rolling."
- "Roll up the filled rice paper to form a cylindrical roll; like a burrito. Seal the edges; it will stick as it is moist. You want a fairly tight roll. Don’t worry if they do not look perfect; as you practice, you rolls will start looking better!"
- "Continue doing the same with rest of the rice paper sheets. (While you are working with each roll, cover the prepared rolls with a wet cloth or towel). Serve fresh Vietnamese summer rolls with spicy peanut dipping sauce or any hot chilli sauce you have."
- "You can make the dipping sauce ahead of time and keep in the refrigerator in a covered container until ready to serve. Adjust the amount of stuffing according to your taste. You can make these ahead of time, but make sure to cover them with a wet cloth or plastic wrap, keeping each of them separate, to prevent them from sticking together and drying out. Have fun using different vegetables for a variety of textures and colors."
