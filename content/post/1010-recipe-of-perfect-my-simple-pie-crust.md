recipeingredient:
- " Strong bread flour"
- " Cake flour"
- " Salted butter"
- " Chilled water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sift together the bread flour and cake flour. Cut the butter into 2 cm cubes and keep chilled."
- "Add butter to the sifted flour, and using a dough scraper, cut the butter while mixing into the flour, until the butter forms bean-sized lumps."
- "Add chilled water to the dough from Step 2, mix with a spatula, then use your hands to bring it together. The key is not to knead it, leaving the dots of butter intact."
- "Form the dough into a 10 cm x 15 cm rectangle,  wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour or more in the refrigerator. When baking pies, it&#39;s easier if you prepare the dough a day in advance."
- "Dust your working surface with flour, then roll out the dough to 1 cm thick, then fold into thirds, bringing the sides into the center."
- "Rotate the dough 90º, then repeat Step 5, 5 times--making a total of six repeated rolling steps."
- "Now, it&#39;s ready to use! The once crumbly dough is now nice and smooth."
- "To make puff pastry If you roll out the dough to 5 mm thick, then freeze them, you&#39;ll have a nice stock of puff pastry!"
- "For apple pies, bake for a total of 40 minutes: 20 minutes at 200°C, then for 20 more minutes at 180°C."
