- "1/2 yellow onion"
- "1/3 green bell pepper"
- "4 clove of garlic"
- "3 packets of sazon goya"
- "4 tbsp soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp mayonaisse"
- "2 tsp mustard"
- "4 tbsp tomato paste"
- "6 pieces of chicken I used chicken thighs and drumsticks"
- "6 peeled red potatoes"
- "2 cup of corn"
- "1 salt and pepper to taste"
- "3 cup of water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Alright, first off get all your ingredients prepped. Like julienne your peppers, mince your garlic and finely chop your onion. Potatoes should be same sized for even cooking (1inch in diameter) and skin your chicken :)"
- "Turn your stove on to high and throw your already minced onion, garlic, and your bell pepper in a nice sized pot . Cook for about five minutes to let it sweat a little. Follow that by throwing in your water. Wait for a simmer for the next step."
- "In a separate bowl, whisk together your tomato paste, sazon Goya, mayonnaise(gives it a great flavor), mustard, and soy sauce. Once mixed, throw it into the pot."
- "Once everything is nicely combined and simmering, throw your chicken in. *make sure you skinned your chicken before hand or your sauce will get too oily and nasty*"
- "Cook the chicken for about 30 minutes and then throw your potatoes and corn in."
- "In the meanwhile it&#39;d be a good idea to make yourself a little side dish to accompany your chicken with. I always like to eat mine with some white rice and a little avocado salad, but you can definitely eat this by its self :)"
- "Cook for another 20 minutes. You&#39;ll know its ready when you poke a potato with a knife and it just slides in with barely no force."
- "Hope you guys enjoy this meal as much as I did growing up.                             Grab a plate and DIG IN!"
