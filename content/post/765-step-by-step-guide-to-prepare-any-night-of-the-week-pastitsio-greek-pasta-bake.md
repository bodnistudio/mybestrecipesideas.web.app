recipeinstructions:
- "Boil the pasta in salted water and a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil , until al dente. Then drain. You shouldn&#39;t need to rinse with cold water, because you added oil during boiling."

- "In a baking tray, you place half of the pasta with some grated cheese and a scoop of the white sauce whle mixing everything evenly. Then you pour on top of the pasta mix, all the minced meat sauce with a scoop of the white sauce. Finally, you place the remaining pasta with some grated cheese ontop of the previous layers. At the end, you pour the remaining white sauce and grated cheese on top of the final pasta layer. You bake for 20- 30 minutes in a pre- heated oven (at 180oC) or until the top layer becomes golden (I know mine looks more brown :-) )."
