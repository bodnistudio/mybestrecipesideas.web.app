It might not be the most beautiful creation, but it will be. Spinach, bacon, artichokes, AND cheese stuffed inside chicken? Hasselback your chicken by cutting shallow slits into your chicken breasts (don&#39;t cut all the way through!) and stuff each slit with bacon and a creamy spinach and artichoke filling.
