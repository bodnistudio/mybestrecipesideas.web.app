recipeingredient:
- "3 Potatoes or sweet potatoes or kabocha squash"
- "80 grams Bread strong flour"
- "1 pinch Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wrap unpeeled potatoes with plastic wrap and heat in the microwave for 4-5 minutes. Remove the skins. Heat some more until softened."
- "Mash the potatoes in a bowl. Add the flour and a pinch of salt and mix with a spoon (it&#39;s okay if it becomes crumbly)."
- "Once no longer powdery, bring it all together with your hands and knead lightly. It&#39;s ready when it&#39;s about the consistency of your ear. (You don&#39;t need to knead it like bread.)"
- "Make small discs of the dough and use a fork to dust the pieces with a bit of bread flour, then use the back of the fork to flatten each piece."
- "At this time, after the gnocchi has been dusted with flour and pressed, you can put them in a Ziploc bag and store in the freezer. Then, when you want to eat, all you have to do is boil."
- "Bring water to a boil in a pot, add the salt, and boil the gnocchi. Boil for a bit after they have risen to the surface. Drain."
- "Top with your favorite sauce. Boiled gnocchi goes well with olive oil, salt, and is especially delicious when sprinkled with Parmesan cheese!"
- "This is gnocchi made with kabocha squash. You can make a boiled dish with the remaining kabocha squash! This sauce is made by mixing together soy milk and cream cheese."
- "[Broccoli sauce] Soft, boiled broccoli is finely chopped and crispy. Sauté it in a frying pan with olive oil and garlic."
- "If you have some, add some anchovies and stir-fry while crushing up the broccoli. Mix in some chopped walnuts, salt, and powdered cheese to finish."
- "[Blue cheese sauce] Warm up 1/2 cup of soy milk in a frying pan. Add a good amount of Gorgonzola cheese (about 80 g)."
- "Add a bit of honey until thickened (any kind of cheese is good). Sprinkle some walnuts on top. You can also add some sautéed onions."
- "[Avocado Basil Sauce] Just mix together some basil pesto and avocado while mashing the avocado. Mash until the avocado retains just a bit of its shape."
- "[Lemon butter or lemon oil] Melt 1 tablespoon (or 2 for 2 people) of butter in a small pot or the microwave. Add 1~2 tablespoons of lemon juice, a bit of salt, and mix."
- "You can also use olive oil instead of butter (and you won&#39;t have to heat it). Boiled lemon oil with parsley is also good. Sprinkle as desired with Parmesan cheese."
