- "2 Potatoes"
- "4 tbsp Cake flour"
- "2 tbsp Olive oil"
- "1 cube Consomm soup stock cube"
- "1 Salt black pepper soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp Miso"
- "600 ml Sweetened soy milk or milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the meat and veggies into your preferred sizes. The salmon skin can be cut easily with kitchen scissors. Cut the stems off the shimeji mushrooms and shred into pieces."
- "Add the potatoes and carrots into a pot, cover, and cook with water at about half the height of the veggies (It was about 200 ml with our pot)."
- "Heat olive oil in a frying pan, and saute the onions. Once they are wilted, add the shimeji and saute well."

- "Once the kabocha is steamed through, place the salmon on top, cover and let the salmon cook through."
- "Mix in salt, black pepper, ground consommé, and cake flour into the frying pan from Step 3. Once it&#39;s no longer floury, gradually pour in 300 ml of soy milk."
- "Once the veggie mixture from Step 6 turns into a creamy consistency of your liking, pour in the soy sauce around the rim, mix it up a little and pour it over the pot from Step 5. Reduce to low heat and stir a little."
- "Once they&#39;re blended well, adjust the tastiness of the white sauce with the second addition of soy milk (I added 300 ml). Dissolve the secret ingredient of miso, mix in and it&#39;s done."
- "Recommended: Mix in yuzu pepper paste into the cream stew when serving. Its fragrance and a touch of spiciness improves the dish."
