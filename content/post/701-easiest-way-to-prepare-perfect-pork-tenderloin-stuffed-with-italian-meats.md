Spread sausage stuffing along pork loin, roll up tight, and tie securely with kitchen twine. Remove pork loin from oven and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. I love anything related to the other white meat (except the oink). This simple recipe just adds some fantastic basic fat and flavor to the already stellar pork tenderloin.

You can purchase any loose and raw Italian sausage (or just about any raw sausage, for that matter!) and stuff. Choose whatever flavor sausage you like. I first looked for mild Italian and couldn&#39;t find any so I chose Bratwurst instead. You can either reserve some of the Lemon-Thyme Dijon sauce or make this new Dijon, White Wine and Tarragon mustard sauce to serve with the pork tenderloin after it comes off the grill. Read Reviews/Leave Comments The tenderloin absorbed all the flavors of the herbs, sausage, and apples simmering away inside it, as well as their juices, which infused every bite with a savory and sweet flavor component.
