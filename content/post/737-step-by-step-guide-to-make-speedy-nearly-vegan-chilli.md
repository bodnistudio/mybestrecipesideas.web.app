I have a Smoky Pumpkin and Tempeh Chili and, of course, the fan-favorite Maple Bourbon Sweet Potato Chili but in all these years, I have neglected to make one of the very first meals I ever cooked - classic vegetarian chili. It was back in college when I was first learning that things like pasta. Just with all chili recipes, this vegan chili was delicious freshly made, but it was even better the next day. The tofu stays perfectly chewy and the flavours deepen and get even more flavourful. To make the best vegan chili ever: Add the olive oil to a large pot and heat over medium-high heat.
