##### The ingredients needed to make Garlic Butter Salmon and Cavalo Nero Pasta:

1. Take 2 x 180g portion of salmon
1. Prepare 4 large cloves garlic, chopped
1. Make ready 3 teaspoons butter
1. Prepare 5 stalks cavalo nero or kale, chopped up
1. Make ready 250 g dried penne pasta
1. Make ready  Olive oil
1. Take  Salt
1. Take  Freshly grated parmesan
1. Make ready 1/4 cup double cream


Plus, I also decided to up the protein content with the addition of some smoked salmon. I figured that the smoked salmon would definitely go with the cream, and the smoky flavour would probably be good with the kale, too. To make the garlic beurre noisette, melt the butter in a small frying pan over a medium heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until it&#39;s golden brown and smells nutty. Add the garlic, let it sizzle for a few seconds, then add the lemon juice and quickly tip onto the cavolo nero.

Cook for a mere minute so that it retains a little crunch, then drain the pasta and cavolo nero well, tossing in a drizzle of olive oil. Set aside while you finish the sauce. When the onions are really soft, turn the heat back up again and add the garlic, frying for just a minute or so until you can smell the aroma wafting up from the pan. Slice the garlic and add to the cavolo nero along with the chilli flakes, capers, a pinch of salt, and a tbsp more of olive oil. Reserve a cup of pasta water from your spaghetti and add into the pan just before the garlic begins to brown.
