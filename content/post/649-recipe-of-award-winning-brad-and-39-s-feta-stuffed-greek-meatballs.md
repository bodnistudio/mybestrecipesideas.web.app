I stuff them full of feta cheese crumbles that I buy at my local market. I am not a fan of using the pre-packaged feta crumbles because I think a big block of feta, that you break apart yourself. The meatballs are super easy to make, simply put all the ingredients, bar the feta, into a bowl and mix together with a fork. Repeat this step with the feta, but each ball should be about the size of a pea. Seal meat tightly around the cheese and olive.
