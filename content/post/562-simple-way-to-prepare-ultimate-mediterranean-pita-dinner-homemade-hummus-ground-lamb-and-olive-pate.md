recipeinstructions:
- "cover the chickpeas in cold water, let rest in a bowl for 7-8 hours"
- "Drain chickpeas. In a pot cover them in water, add the half bouillon, bring to quick boil, then turn heat to low and cook about 30 minutes, until tender. Drain them, save about 4 oz. of the water and let rest at room temperature. This can be done on advance"
- "In a blender, add the chickpeas and all the ingredients for the hummus. Add the cooking water as needed to reduce thickness. Careful with the olive oil, add a little at a time, blend and keep going. Hummus should be thick but not a dense paste. Refrigerate about 30 minutes"
- "Now that you are done with the hummus, do the same to make the olive pate: blend the ingredients, and carefully drizzle olive oil into it. If you pour the oil too fast, the pate will break. Pate should be thinly grounded, not a paste, and moist with oil. Refrigerate 30 minutes."
- "Looking good, now onto the lamb. Heat a pan, add about 3/4 tablespoon of coconut oil, saute the onion over medium to high heat. After 3 minutes add the minced garlic clove. After a minute add the lamb, stir. Add all the spices to the lamb. Now the lamb should get brown quickly, but it looks like it needs some liquid. Hence, the red wine, pour it and let evaporate, a few minutes."
- "Time to serve: I like to quickly heat the pita bread tom make it warm in a pan, no oil or butter, nothing. Just heat 30 seconds each side. In separate serving bowls place the lettuce, the tomatoes and the pate. In  large serving plate, place the ground lamb in the center, surround it with the hummus, add a couple of basil leaves to garnish and open a good bottle of red wine. Buon appetito!"
