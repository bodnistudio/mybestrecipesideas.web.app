When my husband and I lived in St. Louis, there was a Thai food restaurant that we frequented that was unlike any other; I&#39;m salivating just thinking about it. This Thai basil recipe is my attempt at recreating one of my favorite dishes from this restaurant, Pad Gra Prow AKA Thai Basil Beef. Basil is wilted like a leafy green in this thai beef stir fry recipe, then added raw at the end for a double dose of its aromatic flavor.

You pretty much just cook the beef, shallots, garlic and peppers before seasoning with the perfect balance of salty fish sauce, sweet palm sugar. Basil—using Thai holy basil (if you&#39;re lucky enough to find it) makes this spicy beef stir-fry worthy of the name &#34;phat ka-phrao&#34; which means &#34;holy basil stir-fry&#34;. If you can&#39;t find Thai holy basil (it can be hard to track down) just use sweet basil. My version of Thai Beef Basil I usually get from take-out. If you can find Thai Basil and Thai Chilies that would be great. 

So that is going to wrap this up with this special food thai basil beef recipe. Thank you very much for your time. I am confident you can make this at home.
