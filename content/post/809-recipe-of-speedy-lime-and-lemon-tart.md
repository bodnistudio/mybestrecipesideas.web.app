recipeingredient:
- " Base"
- "150 g flour"
- "2 egg yolks"
- "70 g unsalted butter at room temperature"
- "1 teaspoon caster sugar"
- "1/3 teaspoon baking powder"
- "40 ml cold water"
- " Filling"
- "2 limes"
- "1 lemon"
- "1 can condensed milk"
- " Zest of the limes and lemon"
- " Meringue"
- "2 egg whites"
- "100 g icing sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, mix the flour, sugar and baking powder. Add the butter and mix it well with your fingers until it looks like breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolks and the water. Knead the dough just enough until the ingredients are integrated, don’t overdo it! Leave it to rest for 10 minutes, wrapped in cling film in the fridge."
- "Before cutting the lemon and limes to squeeze the juice out, shave the zest off into a small dish and reserve.  In a small bowl, pour the condensed milk, the juice of the 2 limes and the lemon. The condensed milk will start to curd and change its consistency to a paste, add 1/3 of the zest, mix and set aside."
- "Stretch the dough on a sheet of baking paper, approximately 5 mm thin and enough to cover the edges of the tin."
- "Put the tin (25 cm round tin) upside down in the middle of the dough, place one hand under the paper (between the surface and the dough), the other hand on the tin, lift altogether and flip. With the dough facing up, shape it inside the tin and make sure the baking paper is not trapped in a fold. Remove the paper carefully."
- "Once all the edges are done, with a fork, pierce the bottom of the dough to avoid it to lift while baking. Place it in the oven at 200 degrees for around 15 minutes. Leave it to cool."
- "Carefully, remove the base from the tin and place it in a plate. Fill in the tart with the filling and sprinkle 1/3 of the zests. Set aside."
- "In a bowl, beat the egg whites in medium speed until it starts to get airy and fluffy and, making stiff peaks. Increase the speed of the electric hand whisk Add the icing sugar, bit by bit. Add the rest of the lemon zest and mix well."
- "Pour the meringue in a piping bag, start piping small meringues, around, from the edges to the centre."
- "Place the tart in the grill at medium heat but keep an eye on it! It can be removed when the peaks of the meringues are golden brown.  If you want to serve the next day leave it without the meringues in a closed container at room temperature. Make the meringues on the day and Enjoy!"

Creamy and tart lime-orange custard in a flakey, buttery pie—bonus, tricks to a perfect shortcrust pastry shell! When you bite into this tart, the creamy lemon custard hits your palette first, followed immediately by the buttery, crisp shortcrust pastry. These delicious lemon-lime tarts have a wonderfully light, summery flavor, but they contain all natural ingredients and no added sugars at all.

A lemon tart (French: tarte au citron) is a dessert dish, a variety of tart. It has a pastry shell with a lemon flavored filling. In the UK, lemon tart consists of a pastry case (often made in a fluted tart tin) containing a baked lemon custard (usually composed of eggs, sugar, lemon juice and cream).
