recipeingredient:
- " For salmon"
- "2 (6 oz.) salmon fillets or steaks"
- "1 Tablespoon oil"
- " For the glaze"
- "2 Tablespoons miso or dwenjang you could even use Chinese black bean paste if youve got that in your pantry"
- "2 Tablespoons brown sugar"
- "1/4 cup drier rice wine sake or white wine like Chardonnay Sauvignon Blanc Pinot Grigio"
- "1 Tablespoon oil"
- " the green part of 1 green onion finely chopped"
- "1 teaspoon minced garlic about 1 small clove"
- " chopped or julienned green onion for garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Take the salmon out of the fridge and let it come up to room temp before cooking (20 to 30 minutes)."
- "Preheat the oven to 425F."
- "Line an oven proof dish that will fit both your salmon fillets with aluminum foil. This makes for super easy cleanup. (I used one of those Pyrex pie dishes.)"
- "Rub the salmon fillets on all surfaces, skin side included, with the tablespoon of oil, and place them, skin side up, in the foil-lined baking dish."
- "Mix all the glaze ingredients together until the miso is fully incorporated and the brown sugar is dissolved."
- "Pour the glaze over the salmon, and bake for 10 minutes."
- "Optional step: If you want to crisp up the skin a bit, turn the oven to broil, and put the salmon under the broiler for 30 seconds to a minute, checking on it at the 30 second mark. Sweet glazes can burn quickly under the intense heat of a broiler."
- "The way I tell if the salmon is done is to give the center a gentle press down with my index finger as if I&#39;m going to push into the fish about 1/4 of an inch. If it stays indented, it&#39;s undercooked. If it&#39;s resistant to any indentation, it&#39;s probably overcooked. But if it gives to the push and springs right back up, it&#39;s done."
- "Garnish with chopped or julienned green onions and serve with steamed rice. Enjoy!"
