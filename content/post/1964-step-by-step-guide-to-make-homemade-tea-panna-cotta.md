Hello everybody, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, tea panna cotta. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Panna Cotta is one of my favorite desserts - though being a hapa girl, I had to try to put an Asian twist on this Italian classic and make Green Tea Panna Cotta. Green tea goes surprisingly well with desserts - if you&#39;ve had green tea ice cream, then you know how wonderful the combination tastes. A creamy panna cotta is the perfect dessert to infuse with this tea.

Tea Panna Cotta is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions daily. They're fine and they look fantastic. Tea Panna Cotta is something that I have loved my whole life.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook tea panna cotta using 10 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Tea Panna Cotta:

1. Take 2-3 tea bags
1. Get 1 tsp. ginger, grated
1. Prepare 2-3 cardamoms, bruised
1. Take 500 ml. full fat milk
1. Get 1 cup hot water

1. Make ready 1/2 cup powdered brown sugar or to taste
1. Prepare 1/4 tsp. cinnamon powder
1. Take 1/2 tsp. vanilla essence

Panna cotta is pretty simple, even though the name sounds kind of foreign and fancy. Think of your favorite jell-o, only creamy. It&#39;s jiggly and wiggly, but it melts in your mouth and has a milky, sweet, and rich texture that just can&#39;t be beat. For the panna cotta, stir together the green tea and gelatin and set aside briefly.
