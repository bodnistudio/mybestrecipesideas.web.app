A few things to note about this recipe A Black Forest Cake would not be the same without the sour Morello cherries. These tart flavored cherries perfectly complement the rich chocolate flavor of the cake and the sweet whipped cream. I like to use the bottled dark mahogany red colored Morello Cherries that are packed in a light syrup. Black Forest Ice-Cream Cake, vanilla ice-cream, grated chocolate and juicy cherries are sandwiched between sugar-soaked chocolate sponge, topped with whipped cream and decorated temptingly with tantalizing dark chocolate curls and deep red cherries. The combination of the creamy cherry-labneh ice cream and the decadent buttermilk-chocolate cake results in a delicious twist on Black Forest cake â€” perfect for summer birthdays, or just because.
