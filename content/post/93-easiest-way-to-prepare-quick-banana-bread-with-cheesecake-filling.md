- "1/3 cup unsalted butter melted and slightly cooled"
- "3/4 cup brown sugar"
- "1 large egg at room temperature"
- "2 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "1 tsp. baking soda"
- "1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon"

- "8 oz. cream cheese softened to room temperature"
- "1/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 large egg at room temperature"
- "1/2 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "3 tbsp. all purpose flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray a 9x5&#34; loaf pan with non-stick cooking spray, then line the bottom with parchment paper, letting it overhang on the sides to make it easier to get the finished bread out of the pan."
- "In a medium bowl, whisk together the mashed banana, butter, brown sugar, egg, vanilla extract, cinnamon, baking soda and salt. Then use a rubber spatula to fold the flour in until just combined. Set it aside."

- "Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Around the 25-30 minute mark, place a piece of foil loosely over the load so it doesn&#39;t burn across the top."
- "Allow it to cool in the pan for an hour or so, then transfer the finished loaf onto a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and serving."
- "Store bread in an airtight container or wrapped tightly in cling wrap in the fridge."
