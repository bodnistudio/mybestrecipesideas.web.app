It&#39;s a bit confusing when you walk in because the first counter you see is for pickup and payment. Take advantage of the build-your-own salad option and get all your favorite toppings in a baby sized (which is actually quite large) or big sized (enough salad to feed an island of rabbits) salad. Start with your lettuce choice: iceberg, spinach, or romaine. A large bed of chopped romaine forms the base followed by rows of julienned carrots, red pepper, carrots, cilantro, toasted sliced almonds, and warm &amp; comforting roasted sweet potato rounds.

##### Steps to make The Big Salad:

1. Chop up all the veggies and put the into a big bowl.
1. Mix the remaining ingredients and enjoy!


Roasted sweet potato is a comforting, stick-to-your-ribs addition and a nice temperature contrast to the cool, raw veggies. The Ridiculously Big Salad is its own framework. Romaine, spinach, iceberg, seasoned crab, spicy shrimp, fresh red and green peppers, cucumber, red onions, mozzarella cheese, chow mein noodles, Italian herb vinaigrette. I have videos all over the place on it and it&#39;s gotten out of control directing everyone to all of them and so, here is. In a large serving bowl, toss the two bags of washed lettuce, place in fridge to crisp up while chopping veggies.
