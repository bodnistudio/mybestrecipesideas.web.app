- "1 tsp Oregano or Italian seasoning"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add sugar and yeast to warm milk and mix lightly. Allow it to prove for 4 to 5 minutes. It should be frothy and also a bit smelly. If not discard it and make a fresh one. This is really important for a good pizza base."
- "In a mixing bowl, add flour, salt and the olive oil. Now add this yeast mix to the flour and make a smooth dough out of it. Knead this dough until it&#39;s smooth and apply a few drops of olive oil to it and cover it up with a cling wrap and leave it in a dark place in your kitchen to double up in volume."
- "Meanwhile, cut the veggies and keep aside. In a pan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil and saute the garlic mince. Add the boneless chicken cubes to it. Add all the ingredients listed in it&#39;s preparation before covering with a lid."
- "Saute them all on a low heat. Allow it to simmer until done. Next take out the dough and punch it down once to release the air. Grease a pizza pan and start making roundels of the dough."
- "Make medium sized balls out of it. Similarly make all in this way covering the whole pan. Next spread some pizza sauce and the toppings. Bake this in a preheated oven on 180° for 18 to 20 minutes or little more. It depends on the oven temperature. So keep an eye after 15 minutes."
- "After it is baked perfectly, it&#39;s time to add in the Cheese generously. Sprinkle shredded Mozzarella Cheese and tear the Cheddar slices on top of it followed by some Italian seasoning. Pop it back in the Oven just until the Cheese melts. Cheesyliciously yours to dig in now. Gooey and cheesy to the last bite."
