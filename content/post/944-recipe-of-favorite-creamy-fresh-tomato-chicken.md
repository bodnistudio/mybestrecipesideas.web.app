Fresh roma tomatoes, garlic and basil simmered in olive oil and butter till the tomatoes completely break down into a nice creamy consistency that coat every bit of the chicken. I like to add a little bit of cream towards the end to give this dish a luscious consistency. Another great side for the Italian Chicken in tomato sauce would be these roasted smashed potatoes with garlic and parmesan. Now here&#39;s one last tip before getting to the recipe. To make this Italian chicken in creamy tomato sauce even more delicious, add plenty of herbs like parsley, thyme and basil.
