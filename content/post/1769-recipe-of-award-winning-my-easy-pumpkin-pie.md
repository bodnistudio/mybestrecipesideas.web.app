Pillsbury™ Pet-Ritz® frozen deep-dish pie crust eliminates the need to fuss with a crust, and the super-easy pumpkin filling can be prepped all in one bowl and poured into the crust in just a few minutes. My mom absolutely loves pumpkin pie, but dislikes how high the sugar content is. Not to mention, the crust itself is more than one serving of carbs and you can&#39;t just have one piece of pumpkin pie; it&#39;s unheard of. These pumpkin bars taste like pumpkin pie with a sweeter, slightly crunchy crust.
