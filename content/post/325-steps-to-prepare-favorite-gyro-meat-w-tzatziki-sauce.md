- " Gyro Meat"
- "1 lb ground beef"

- "1/2 large sweet onion finely grated"
- "2 garlic cloves finely grated"
- "1 tbsp zaatar"
- "2 tsp Montreal seasoning"
- "1 tsp dried oregano"

- "1 1/2 cups Greek yogurt"
- "1/2 tsp dried dill"
- "1/2 tsp granulated garlic"
- "1/4 tsp crushed mint leaves"
- "1 tbsp lemon juice"
- "1 tsp extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 cucumber seeded grated and drained"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all gyro meat ingredients together in large mixing bowl and let sit overnight. If you don&#39;t have or like Montreal seasoning use salt and pepper to your taste. I just happen to prefer Montreal seasoning over plan salt and pepper on red meat."
- "Blitz the meat mixture in a food processor to get to a fine consistency. I had to do it in 4 batches in my processor. Once it&#39;s all done press into a well greased meatloaf pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight."
- "Steps 1 and 2 can all be all in one day. I just took the approach of letting the meat marinade and also resting to firm up after blitzing. Chili always tastes better the next day so why not gyro meat."
- "Mix all the ingredients together for the Tzatziki sauce except the cucumber. Let sit overnight to allow the dried spices rehydrate a bit and flavor the yogurt. Don&#39;t over do the seasoning at the beginning because the flavors will intensify, if to strong more yogurt can be added."
- "Pre heat the oven to 400°. Add the grated and drained cucumber to the tzatziki sauce."
- "Bake the gyro meat covered for 15 minutes then uncover and bake for another hour. Keep an eye on it to make sure the meat doesn&#39;t get too much color, recover if needed to finishing cooking."
- "Drain the fat off and let the gyro meat rest for a few minutes. Stand on a cutting board lengthwise and shave off what you&#39;re going to eat right away."
- "Serve on homemade pitas with the tzatziki sauce and spinach pie on the side!"
