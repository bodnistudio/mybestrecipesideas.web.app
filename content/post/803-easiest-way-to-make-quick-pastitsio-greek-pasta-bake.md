My husband made this recipe for us a couple of months ago. It&#39;s not my favorite version; I found the cream sauce way too starchy and pasty. I also thought tossing the pasta with butter &amp; parmesan made it a little too heavy and rich-tasting. Add the pasta to the meat and tomato sauce, and pour the mixture into a baking dish. Heat olive oil in a pan and cook garlic, onions and beef mince until meat is browned.
