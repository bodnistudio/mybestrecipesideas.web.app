- "First off, these were my favorite cupcakes as a kid &amp; sadly I don&#39;t see too many people making them anymore. They are soooo cute, fun, easy to make and the little ones absolutely love them. I suggest &#34;Joy&#34; ice cream cones &amp; &#34;Betty Crocker Party Rainbow Chip SuperMoist Cake Mix&#34; - the rainbow chips add to the cuteness. If you&#39;re icing by hand you may only need one container of icing - but if you&#39;re swirling it up with a piping / decorating bag you will need 2-3 containers of icing. Also - buy extra cones - plan on finding a few cracked or broken unusable cones."
- "Preheat oven to 350 - remove second / middle oven rack if necessary."
- "Prepare cake mix according to directions."
- "Fill cones no more than 3/4 full. Over filling causes the cakemix to bake/spill over the sides - you want it to rise just a bit over the top of the cone. I like &#34;Joy&#34; cones because they have a line inside the cone - i pour the cake mix so it&#39;s about a 1/2&#34; over that line."
- "So it&#39;s time to bake them. I&#39;ve heard people say they have a hard time getting these cuties into the oven without knocking them over. If you forsee that issue - you can put you&#39;re baking sheets/tray in the oven first, and then carefully put each conecake onto the baking sheet. Just make sure you use your bottom oven rack - and pull the middle rack out before heating the oven."
- "Bake 15 - 20 minutes or until toothpick in center of cake comes out clean."
- "Cool &amp; frost. I suggest using a 1M tip &amp; decorating piping bag."
- "Drain cherries &amp; blot off extra liquid with a paper towel. Put a cherry on top of each cupcake :)"
- "Last - but not least - throw lotsa cute rainbow sprinkles on tops."
- "These are best when eaten the same day as they are made - the cone starts getting a bit chewy/leathery after a day. Transporting these cupcakes can be interesting, lol, they like to topple over. I remember a friends mom used a pizza box &amp; cut small squares all over the box to fit the cones into. I use 6 - large / 2lb. white candy boxes &amp; cut four squares in each box. Then you just gotta find a box or container that&#39;s wide enough &amp; high enough to fit them in - you deff don&#39;t wanna topple or smash your super cute creations. Enjoy ❤"

##### Steps to make Too Cute Ice Cream Cone Cupcakes:

1. First off, these were my favorite cupcakes as a kid &amp; sadly I don&#39;t see too many people making them anymore. They are soooo cute, fun, easy to make and the little ones absolutely love them. I suggest &#34;Joy&#34; ice cream cones &amp; &#34;Betty Crocker Party Rainbow Chip SuperMoist Cake Mix&#34; - the rainbow chips add to the cuteness. If you&#39;re icing by hand you may only need one container of icing - but if you&#39;re swirling it up with a piping / decorating bag you will need 2-3 containers of icing. Also - buy extra cones - plan on finding a few cracked or broken unusable cones.
1. Preheat oven to 350 - remove second / middle oven rack if necessary.
1. Prepare cake mix according to directions.
1. Fill cones no more than 3/4 full. Over filling causes the cakemix to bake/spill over the sides - you want it to rise just a bit over the top of the cone. I like &#34;Joy&#34; cones because they have a line inside the cone - i pour the cake mix so it&#39;s about a 1/2&#34; over that line.
1. So it&#39;s time to bake them. I&#39;ve heard people say they have a hard time getting these cuties into the oven without knocking them over. If you forsee that issue - you can put you&#39;re baking sheets/tray in the oven first, and then carefully put each conecake onto the baking sheet. Just make sure you use your bottom oven rack - and pull the middle rack out before heating the oven.
1. Bake 15 - 20 minutes or until toothpick in center of cake comes out clean.
1. Cool &amp; frost. I suggest using a 1M tip &amp; decorating piping bag.
1. Drain cherries &amp; blot off extra liquid with a paper towel. Put a cherry on top of each cupcake :)
1. Last - but not least - throw lotsa cute rainbow sprinkles on tops.
1. These are best when eaten the same day as they are made - the cone starts getting a bit chewy/leathery after a day. Transporting these cupcakes can be interesting, lol, they like to topple over. I remember a friends mom used a pizza box &amp; cut small squares all over the box to fit the cones into. I use 6 - large / 2lb. white candy boxes &amp; cut four squares in each box. Then you just gotta find a box or container that&#39;s wide enough &amp; high enough to fit them in - you deff don&#39;t wanna topple or smash your super cute creations. Enjoy ❤
