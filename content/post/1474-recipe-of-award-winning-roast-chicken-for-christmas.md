- "3 tbsp Water or sake"
- "3 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "3 tbsp Mirin"
- "2 tsp  1 tablespoon Sugar"
- "1 Black pepper"
- "1 Cherry tomatoes"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the chicken. Cut along the bone to break and remove the joints."
- "Cut the potato in half and then slice into 1-1.5 cm half moon shaped pieces. Break the broccoli into small tufts. Cut the carrot into star-shaped pieces."
- "Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan and pan-fry the chicken on medium heat with the skin side down. Also add the potatoes and sprinkle with salt. Pan-fry on medium-low heat for about 7-8 minutes."
- "Flip over the chicken and add the water and broccoli. Cover with a lid and steam on medium-low heat for about 6-7 minutes. Remove the vegetables and arrange them on a plate."
- "Add the ☆ ingredients to the same frying pan as the chicken to form a glaze. Flip the chicken over and cook on medium heat for 1-2 minutes to allow the flavor to seep in."

- "Serve on a plate and decorate with vegetables. You can also arrange each chicken on a separate plate."
- "Note: Instead of carrots, cherry tomatoes are also fine. You can also microwave the potatoes and broccoli first, and then just brown them in the frying pan last."
- "If you want to bake these in the oven, bake for 20-30 minutes at 200°C. Midway through, divide the sauce into two batches and pour over the chicken. Don&#39;t let the sauce burn."
- "If using smaller chicken, 3 tablespoons of the flavoring ingredients is too much, so use a smaller amount. If you&#39;re not a fan of sweet flavors, you don&#39;t need to add the sugar."
- "I recommend these vegetables -."
