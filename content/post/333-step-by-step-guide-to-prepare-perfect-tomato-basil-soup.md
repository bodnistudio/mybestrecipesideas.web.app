recipeingredient:
- "2  28 oz cans stewed whole tomato"
- "2 carrots"
- "1 onion"
- "1 sweet potato"
- "2 carton chicken stock 32 oz each"
- "1 c celery"
- "3 tablespoons tomato paste"
- "to taste Salt  Pepper"
- "1 pinch sugar"
- " Shredded Parmesan cheese"
- " Basil leaves cut thin"
- "3 tablespoon neutral oil"
- "12 oz Heavy cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep: Rustic cut the onion, and celery. Peel, thin “coin slice” the carrot, and cut sweet potato to approx. 1 inch dice. Set aside"
- "In a deep saucepan, add neutral oil, sweet potato, and carrots. Sauté over medium-low heat until both soften a bit, then add: onion and celery. Continue cooking"
- "When celery and onion soften, add tomato paste, and increase heat to full medium. As heat increases you want a slight burn of the paste on the bottom of the pan. Slight!!! Nothing crazy!"
- "Once you get a decent char from the tomato paste, add chicken stock, and tomatoes.(do not drain tomatoes) Reduce heat to medium-low, and reduce stock a bit. This is where you build flavor through reduction of water in the soup."
- "Once you’ve reduced stock, add cream, reduce to desired consistency over a medium-low heat."
- "Once the soup is at the proper consistency, remove from heat. Let cool for 10 minutes, run the soup through a blender until creamy. The extra carton of stock is for loosening the soup if needed."
- "Place into proper container, and refrigerate. Garnish with basil/parmesan upon serving for best results!"
