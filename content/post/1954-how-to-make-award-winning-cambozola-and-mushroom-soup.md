recipeingredient:
- "1-1 oz. packet assorted dried mushrooms"
- "1/2 lb white mushrooms chopped"
- "1/2 lb crimini mushrooms chopped"
- "1 shallot finely chopped"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "1/4 cup brandy"
- "1 tbsp all purpose flour"
- "4 sprigs fresh thyme"
- "2 cups cold water"
- "2 cups chicken broth"
- "100 g cambozola rind removed"
- "1/4 cup heavy cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bloom the dried mushrooms in 2 cups warm water for 20 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and give them a quick rinse. Chop any large pieces into bite-sized chunks. Strain the blooming water (now mushroom broth) through a coffee filter to remove any sediment, and set it aside."
- "Melt 1 tbsp butter in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add all the mushrooms. Fry until the water the mushrooms give off evaporates and they take on a bit of golden colour. This should take about 10 minutes."
- "Stir the shallots and garlic into the pot and continue frying 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. Pour in the brandy. Let cook until most of the brandy has been absorbed, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle in the flour and stir for 1 minute to coat."
- "Add the thyme, mushroom broth, chicken stock, and 2 cups cold water to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 15 minutes."
- "Fish the thyme sprigs out of the pot. Break the cambozola into chunks and add it a little at a time to the pot, stirring to melt it in. Remove any big pieces of mold that float to the top; they&#39;ll turn rubbery. When all the cheese has melted, turn off the heat and stir in the cream to finish."
