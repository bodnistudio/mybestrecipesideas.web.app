		A deeply savoury lamb and vegetable filling topped with creamy mashed potato and a golden cheese crust, it&#39;s straightforward to make and is brilliant for making ahead..with the kind of refrigeration we had in our homes, cooked meat could be kept much more safely than raw.
	
		Therefore, when housewives bought their Sunday meat they selected pieces large enough to.
	
		Some stores may be limited to curbside pickup only.
	
		It&#39;s a good filler, and with something like shepards/cottage pie, the meaty flavour is still strong enough that you don&#39;t notice the extra grated carrot.

		Hey OP, this is what I do.
	
		I&#39;m a really lazy cook and I use instant mashed potatoes and frozen corn whenever I make shepherd&#39;s pie. shepards pie nutrition facts and nutritional information.
	
		So I&#39;m biting the bullet and making my fiancee Shepards Pie for tomorrow for his birthday.
	
		I know its not a dish that screams &#34;Spring&#34; but its his favorite.
	
		Im going to use a Gordan Ramsay recipe from the Times where the standout flavors seem like lamb, worcestershire sauce,red wine, and thyme.
