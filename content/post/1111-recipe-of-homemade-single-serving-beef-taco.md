When I tried to search for taco seasoning recipes to replace a packet in the past, all I could find were recipes for HUGE amounts of taco seasoning. This taco recipe is the classic Tex-Mex-style version of tacos that many Americans grow up with: seasoned ground beef stuffed in a crispy taco shell with additional fillings like lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and sour cream.
