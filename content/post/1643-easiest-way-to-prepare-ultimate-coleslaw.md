##### The ingredients needed to make Coleslaw:

1. Make ready 1 cabbage
1. Get 4 carrots
1. Get 3 cucumber
1. Take 3 tomatoes
1. Get 6 eggs
1. Make ready  Salad cream
1. Prepare 2 tea spns of sugar


Start with the best coleslaw ingredients. Green cabbage is the classic slaw base, though red cabbage&#39;s peppery flavor and pretty color make it pleasant addition. Both are smooth-leaved, dense, and crunchy (unlike Napa cabbage, which is very popular in Asian cooking, and savoy cabbages, which have a much more subtle flavor and less-assertive. This coleslaw is a great side dish to bring to summer potlucks, and pairs well with recipes like Slow Cooker Pulled Pork, tacos (especially fish tacos), lunch wraps with deli meat, hot dogs, and more.

I don&#39;t recommend it, as raw cabbage does not freeze well. Make coleslaw dressing: In a small mixing bowl whisk together the mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar and honey. If needed season with a bit of salt. Pour dressing over shredded cabbage mixture: Place shredded coleslaw mix in a large bowl then pour the dressing mixture over. Toss together: Toss to evenly coat.
