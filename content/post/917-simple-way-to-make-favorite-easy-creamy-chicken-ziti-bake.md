This creamy chicken pasta casserole would be perfect for those nights when you don&#39;t have a lot of time, but need something filling to feed the family. Try RICOTTA CHEESE instead of sour cream and skip the provolone for a real Italian version of Baked Ziti. Mix an egg into a pound of ricotta to make it nice and creamy, and toss with the ziti. Layer sauce first (so you don&#39;t need to butter the pan), then ziti/cheese, mozzarella, sprinkle with parm and a little dried oregano or basil, then. Ziti pasta bakes with layers of creamy tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese in an easy and comforting dish that&#39;s ready in less than an hour.
