I love the combination of savory and fiery with a hint of sweetness. I wouldn&#39;t claim that this is THE authentic Thai fried rice recipe, but It comes very close to one of my favorite fried rice I ordered in Prachin Buri. The key is to use leftover, cold, jasmine rice and Thai fish sauce ONLY, no soy sauce or it will be Chinese fried rice. Japanese fried rice- Mirin (sweet Japanese cooking wine), Japanese soy sauce. Indonesian nasi goreng- sambal (Indonesian chili paste) Despite the different seasonings, the key to making the fried rice smell aromatic is keeping the rice dry during stir-frying.
