This lasagna was designed for a deep-dish baking pan. You can use a standard nine-by-thirteen-inch baking pan, but you will have extra sauce. For the sauce, heat the butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. A classic Bolognese lasagna is different from the version most common in the United States. Instead of thick layers of ricotta and mozzarella cheese, lasagne alla bolognese features delicate layers of fresh pasta (spinach is traditional, but plain fresh egg pasta works fine, or even dried in a pinch) coated in a luxurious mix of hearty ragù bolognese (slow-cooked meat sauce) and creamy.
