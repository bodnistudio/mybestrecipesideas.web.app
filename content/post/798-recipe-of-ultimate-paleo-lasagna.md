recipeingredient:
- " 1st Layer"
- "1 lb Zucchini shredded"
- "1 cup Coconut flour"
- "1 Egg"
- "1 tsp Sea salt"
- "1/4 cup Shredded Parmesan cheese"
- " Meat Layer"
- "1 tbsp Olive oil"
- "1/2 cup Onion"
- "1 lb Mild ground Italian sausage"
- "1 lb Hot ground Italian sausage"
- "1 tbsp Minced garlic"
- "1 can Stewed tomatoes diced"
- "2 tbsp Tomato Paste"
- "1 tbsp Italian seasoning"
- " Cheese Layer"
- "1 1/2 cup Shredded mozzarella"
- "1/4 Shredded Parmesan"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 325"
- "Shred fresh zucchini."
- "Place shredded zucchini in a clean kitchen tea towel. (Don&#39;t use a terry-cloth towel unless you like lint in your food!) Wrap the towel around the zucchini and squeeze by twisting the towel. Be sure to stand over the sink! This removes the excess moisture from the zucchini."
- "Place zucchini in a large bowl and add the rest of the ingredients for the first layer and mix well. I like using my dough hook even though this will not be a true dough. A fork or your hands will do just fine."
- "Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onions and saute until translucent."
- "Add sausage and garlic. Stir until browned."
- "Add the rest of the Meat Layer ingredients and simmer on medium for 10 mins or so. Remove from heat."
- "Grease a 13x9 glass dish. Add half of 1st Layer mixture and press with your hand or spoon until the layer touches the sides. Try to make the layer smooth and even, but don&#39;t worry if it isn&#39;t perfect. No one will know!"
- "OPTIONAL: This is a very most dish. If you wish you can bake the first layer for 10-15 minutes to eliminate some of that moisture. This will also create a firmer bottom (kind of crumbly though). If you choose this option, watch it carefully so it doesn&#39;t brown. This will greatly alter the taste of the coconut flour and make it taste too &#34;dessert-like.&#34;"
- "Spoon half of the Meat Layer over the 1st Layer. Spread it out to all four sides like the other layer."
- "Sprinkle half of the Cheese Layer over the Meat Layer."
- "Repeat the layers"
- "Place in the oven and cook until the cheese bubbles and starts to brown. (Approx 15-20 mins)"
- "Remove from the oven and allow 5-10 minutes for it to &#34;set up.&#34;"
- "Serve with a nice salad or my fav: Roasted Brussels Sprouts"

Full of fresh veggies and baby bella mushrooms, this lasagna is an ode to fresh and beautiful ingredients (plus tomato paste and sauce). Awesome Paleo Lasagna Recipe Paleo &#34;Lasagna&#34; My friend Christina, submitted the recipe for the awesome walnut red pepper dip that I introduced in my Super Bowl blog, also sent me a recipe for paleo lasagna. Since the cheese is a big part of the flavor and texture of lasagna, that presents quite a challenge. For both flavor and texture, in this recipe we use two sauces, a tomato-based meat sauce and a creamy béchamel, plus layers of nut-based ricotta.

Paleo isn&#39;t about depriving yourself and getting rid of foods because they contain ingredients you can&#39;t have. It&#39;s about finding creative ways to use the foods that are allowed to re-create the foods you enjoy that aren&#39;t allowed. Traditional lasagna gets the kibosh because of the thick noodles. Missing lasagna because nightshades are off the menu? This AIP compliant paleo lasagna takes our faux-mato sauce and pairs it with plenty of protein and zucchini noodles. 

So that is going to wrap it up for this exceptional food paleo lasagna recipe. Thanks so much for reading. I am sure that you can make this at home.
