		In fact, I think this version is even a little better than key lime pie.
	
		This Key Lime Pie recipe can also be made with lemons - replace the five limes with four lemons for a lovely fresh twist.
	
		Or, try gingernut biscuits in the base they go beautifully with the tangy lime.
	
		In medium bowl, mix condensed milk, egg yolks, lemon peel, lime peel, lemon juice and lime juice until blended.
	
		Being a Floridian, I have had my share of both very good and very bad Key Lime Pie.
