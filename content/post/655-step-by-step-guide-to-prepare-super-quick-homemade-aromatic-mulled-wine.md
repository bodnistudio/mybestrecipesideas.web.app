My first cup was in Lyon, France. There&#39;s a long tradition of fortifying wine with honey and aromatic spices, especially in winter months. And while most modern recipes for mulled wine call for sugar, you make this mulled wine with honey instead. Honey gives the wine a lovely, mild sweetness with floral undertones than complement the flavor of sweet spices like star anise, cardamom, and cinnamon. I prefer to make mulled wine with white wine because I think it gives a smoother flavor.
