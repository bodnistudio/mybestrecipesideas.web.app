- "1 to 2 drops for each Lemon juice optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the shiso leaves. Cut out heart shapes of a 2-cm-length in the middle using a pair of scissors. When you do this fold the shiso leaves in half first and cut out half-heart-shapes to make symmetric hearts."
- "Make 10 heart shapes. Julienne the leftover shiso leaves and pat dry well with kitchen paper. (If the leaves are moist it makes lumps when they are mixed with the rice.)"

- "I folded the crab sticks in half and made slits on the ends. I used them to decorate the dish with daikon radish sprouts in this picture. Sprinkle with lemon juice to your liking."
- "You don&#39;t have to use top-quality prosciutto. I used a slightly cheaper one, like in the picture."
