recipeingredient:
- "1 cup vegetable oil"
- "1/2 cup water"
- "4 cups flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the water and oil together thoroughly until cloudy (I use warm or lukewarm water, rather than cold)."
- "Pile all the flour up on the surface you will use to knead and roll the dough, make a little reservoir in the middle."
- "Slowly add the water/oil mixture (keep it mixed well - remix as needed) a little at a time, mixing it in with the surrounding flour by hand."
- "When the dough is completely combined it will be very soft and fairly sticky. I use flour liberally while rolling it out. It sticks easily to rolling surfaces so keep this in mind as you work with it. I use a wooden rolling pin. The recipe makes enough for a generous top and bottom crust. The pie plates I use are oversized and I always have enough dough."
- "The crust doesn&#39;t change color much as it cooks. I typically cook the cherry and apple pies I make for about an hour at 350 degrees in a convection oven, and it comes out perfectly."
