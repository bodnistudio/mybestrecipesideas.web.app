To be fair, most of us do use teabags for convenience as we make so many cups of tea per day, often in a hurry and with those you can&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t) add the milk before the water in a cup as the milk hinders the ability of the tea to infuse by partly blocking the holes in the bag but for the best cup of tea, from the pot, discretely. Let the tea in the tea pot stand for a few minutes for the tea to brew. The tea cosy will keep the tea warm for a long time. Take your tea cup and saucer (prererably of the finest English bone china) pour a little milk into the cup (milk in first, please!) and then fill with the clear, hot, amber liquid of life!
