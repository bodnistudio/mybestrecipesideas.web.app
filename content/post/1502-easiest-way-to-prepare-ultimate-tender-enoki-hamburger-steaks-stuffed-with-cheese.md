recipeingredient:
- "300 grams Mixed ground beef and pork"
- "300 grams Enoki mushrooms"
- "1/2 Onion"
- "1 Egg"
- "66 ml Panko"
- "1 tbsp Miso I used Shinshu Miso"
- "1 Salt and pepper"
- "4 pieces Cheese I used processed cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring the cheese to room temperature.  If the cheese is cold, it won&#39;t melt when you cook the hamburgers."
- "Enoki mushrooms absorb water when you wash them, so shake off excess water so that the patties don&#39;t become soggy. I don&#39;t wash them."
- "Chop the onion and enoki into 1cm pieces.  Blend in a food processor until paste-like."
- "Transfer the mixture from step 3 into a bowl. Add all the other ingredients, except for the cheese. Knead well and the resulting mixture should be very soft."
- "Divide the mixture into 4 portions. With your hands, add the cheese slice in the middle and cover it up, and shape into a patty. The patty will be very soft, so place it immediately in a nonstick pan."
- "Fry over medium to high heat. They are very soft, so fry until a crust forms, and the shape is well set. Flip the patties over, and do the same with the other side."
- "When both sides are well browned, flip them again and cover the pan with a lid. Cook the pan and reduce the heat to low while cooking."
- "The hamburgers are done when they release clear juice when pierced with a skewer or toothpick. Cover with the lid again, and let it rest for a few minutes in residual heat."
- "They&#39;re delicious as they are, but you could eat it with your favorite sauce."
- "Here I served the hamburger with grated daikon radish and shiso dressing. I recommend this."
