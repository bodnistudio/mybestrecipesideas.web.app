The smokiness and the sweet bite from the bell peppers make this smoked sausage and peppers with rice dish a perfect weeknight meal when you&#39;ve got other things. A mixture of sausage, brown rice, and vegetables is used to stuff sweet bell peppers. I love peppers and have no problem coming up with ideas on how to use them, and recently when I was stuck for dinner ideas and didn&#39;t want to make a trip to the store, I decided to make stuffed peppers. Using the long grain rice just did not work for me, the filling fell apart too easily.
