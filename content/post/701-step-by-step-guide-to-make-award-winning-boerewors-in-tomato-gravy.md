The name is derived from the Afrikaans/Dutch words boer (&#34;farmer&#34;) and wors (&#34;sausage&#34;). Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan and fry the boerewors until browned. Add the onion and sauté for a few minutes until soft. In fact I cant really eat it without some sort of tomato intervention. The boerewors has all the flavour so you need very little seasoning apart from a pinch of chilli (optional), salt and pepper.
