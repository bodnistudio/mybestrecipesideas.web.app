<h3>Instructions to make Chicken Quesadilla Pie:</h3>

		<li>
			In a medium mixing bowl, place the chicken, black beans, onion and 1 cup of the cheese. Stir to combine. If you&#39;re using unseasoned shredded chicken, then add the seasonings to taste...since my crock pot chicken I used was already seasoned, I skipped this step..

		<li>
			Pour the chicken mix over the top of the tortilla. Sprinkle the cilantro over the top..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, flour, salt and baking powder until all combined and blended. Pour over the top of the chicken mix..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Sprinkle the remaining cup of cheese over the top of the chicken mix..
