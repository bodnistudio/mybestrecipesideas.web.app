##### Instructions to make Taco Salad:

1. Cook meat and add taco seasoning. Make rice according to box. (I like rice pilaf but Spanish or Mexican rice works)
1. Cut lettuce, carrots, peppers, cilantro and whatever other veggie toppings you want.
1. Heat the tortillas and build salad with desired toppings.


In a skillet, brown ground beef; drain well. Combine beef, lettuce, tomatoes, dressing, corn chips and cheese in a large serving bowl; toss well to mix. Brown ground beef, drain grease, adding taco seasoning and following directions on package. When ground beef is cold, place in a large bowl and add all remaining ingredients. A super-quick blend of reduced-fat sour cream and salsa serves double duty as salad dressing and seasoning for the meat in our updated version of Tex-Mex taco salad.
