It was widely known as S**t on a Shingle. I hated it since my mom wasn&#39;t as good a cook as she was a reader. It was always lumpy with bits of flour bursting through the sauce. Anyway, we also had Tuna Salad on a piece of toast. Mom made it with Kraft Sandwich Spread, grated cubes of hard boiled egg and chunks of celery.
