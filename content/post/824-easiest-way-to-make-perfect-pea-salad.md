Growing up, a friend of the family made us this pea salad that we love to this day. It&#39;s just standard stuff: peas, mayonnaise, egg, cheese, and onion. In a bowl, combine the peas, cheese, onion, Miracle Whip, salt and pepper; mix well. However I have put chicken chunks in pea salad. You can also use less mayo than the recipe calls for and if you prefer salad dressing instead use that.
