- "Spoon/press some of the breadcrumb mixture on top of each mussel, trying to cover the mussel itself as far as possible. If you like, put a little of the mussel cooking juice in the bottom of the shell to help keep the mussel moist."
- "Bake the mussels for approx 7-10 minutes until gently golden on top. Serve warm or room temp (don&#39;t re-heat them as they will likely go dry and/or tough)."
