For Tuscan white bean and kale soup with spicy Italian sausage, I use celery, onion, carrots and garlic. Sweating the chopped veg with the browned sausage not only rounds the flavors, but it also provides Pasta - I&#39;ve made this soup with all sorts of small-ish pasta, from macaroni to orecchiette to shells. It&#39;s just such an amazingly cozy soup, loaded with wilted baby spinach, white beans, and my favorite orzo pasta. And to top it off, I threw in some freshly squeezed lemon.
