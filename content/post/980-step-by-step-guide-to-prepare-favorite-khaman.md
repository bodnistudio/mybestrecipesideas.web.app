- "Making dhokla batter After 4 to 5 hours, drain all the water and add the soaked dal, rice, methi seeds in a grinder jar. depending on the size of the grinder jar, you can grind in one or two batches. Also add 1 green chilli (chopped), 1-inch ginger (chopped) and ½ teaspoon cumin seeds."
- "Add water in parts and grind to a batter where you can feel the fine rava or sooji like consistency of rice in the batter. the batter should not be ground fine. overall you can add ¾ to 1 cup water while grinding. Take the batter in a bowl or pan. add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 pinch asafoetida, 3 tablespoons curd and 1 teaspoon salt or add as required."
- "Mix very well. cover and let the batter ferment for 8 to 9 hours. in a warm or hot climate, it will take 5 to 6 hours for the batter to ferment. in a cold or cool climate, it can take more time. After fermentation, the batter will have tiny air bubbles in it and a faint sour aroma."
- "Before steaming dhokla, grease a pan with some oil on the base as well as the sides. In a large pot or pressure cooker, take 2.5 cups water. place a stand inside. keep the pot or the cooker on a medium-low to medium flame and let the water come to a boil. Now add 1 teaspoon lemon juice to the fermented batter."
- "Add 2 teaspoons oil to the batter. mix very well, now sprinkle 1 teaspoon eno (fruit salt) or ⅓ teaspoon baking soda all over the batter evenly, with brisk and quick movements of a spoon or spatula, mix the eno or baking soda very well in the batter. the mixing has to be done very well or else some parts of the dhokla won’t be spongy and porous. mix very well and do it quickly."
- "Meanwhile, the water has come to a boil. pour the batter in the greased pan. level the top with a spatula or spoon. sprinkle some red chilli powder on top. this step is optional. steaming dhokla, place the pan on the stand inside the large pot or cooker."
- "Cover with a lid and steam the batter on medium flame for 20 to 25 minutes or more. if using pressure cooker, then remove the vent weight (whistle) from the lid, a skewer or toothpick inserted in the dhokla should come out clean. Place the dhokla pan on a stand and let it become warm or cool at room temperature."
- "Then place a plate on top of the pan and turn upside down. tap the pan and the dhokla will gently glide on to the plate. Place another plate on the dhokla and again turn upside down. the top side will face you know. Cut the dhokla with a knife to get medium or large bite-sized pieces."
- "Tempering for dhokla- heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small pan or tadka pan. add ½ teaspoon mustard seeds. let the mustard seeds crackle. when the mustard seeds finish crackling, add 1 to 2 teaspoons sesame seeds and give a stir.  Then add 1 pinch asafoetida and 7 to 8 curry leaves."
- "Fry for a few seconds till the curry leaves become crisp. carefully add 2 tablespoons water as the mixture splutters. You can even switch off the flame when adding water.  Then add 2 teaspoons sugar or add as per taste, stir and mix the sugar with the water."
- "Let the water come to a boil. Then switch off the flame and add this entire tempering mixture all over the dhokla. Lastly, add 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves and 2 tablespoons fresh grated coconut all over the dhokla. Take each piece carefully and serve with coriander chutney."
