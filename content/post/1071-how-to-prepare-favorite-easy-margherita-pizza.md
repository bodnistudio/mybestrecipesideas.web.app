- "Add the pizza sauce in small amounts, covering the dough just enough for however much you like."
- "Please note that all ingredients are enough for both pizzas, so use sparingly. Top with mozerella cheese all over. Slice the Roma tomatoes and add to pizza. Add the fresh basil. You may add olives and pepperoni if you like. Make your other pizza."
- "Place the pizzas back into the oven for 5 minutes. Remove and cut into squares."
