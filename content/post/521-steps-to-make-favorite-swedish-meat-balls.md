Traditionally you&#39;ll find them served up with mashed potatoes and paired with a side of bright, sweet lingonberry jam (which tastes a lot like cranberry sauce). He loves Swedish Meatballs and was really craving them. I substituted ground turkey, low fat chicken broth, vegan plant based butter and a plant based half n half. Turned out rich, creamy (dairy free) and delicious!

I eat Ikea&#39;s meatballs four times a year as my brother and I go to all four of their all-you-can-eat-buffets near Easter, midsummer, in the fall when the crawfish run and near Sct.. Italian meatballs can be made with any combination of beef, Italian sausage, pork, and/or veal while Swedish meatballs are typically made with equal parts ground beef and ground pork. Italian meatballs are made with herbs like oregano, basil, and Italian seasoning; Swedish meatballs use warmer, sweeter spices like allspice and nutmeg. Actually Swedish meatballs are made with lesser ingredients: ground meat, breadcrumbs, egg, salt and pepper. I do them in the oven and exclude the breadcrumbs - less carbs!
