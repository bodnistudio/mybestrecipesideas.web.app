- "1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar"
- "1/4 cup pineapple juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all 4 ingredients and place in heavy saucepan."

- "Stir briskly. It may separate at first, but keep whisking and it will combine as thickening."
- "Once thickened, brush over chicken, pork, ribs, ham etc.. This is a versatile sauce and I like coating my meat while grilling a few times while flipping so it gets a sticky consistency."
- "Serve as sandwich, plain with sides and I love it over a bed of wild rice. I use pineapple juice also when cooking my rice. Whatever the amount of water it calls for, use half juice half water if you like."
- "I sometimes use a small amount of crushed pineapple to give it some texture and it is great!"
- "Makes 1 cup of glaze. You can double if you need more."
