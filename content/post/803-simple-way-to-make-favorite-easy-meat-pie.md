It&#39;s a lot of ingredients and soup tossed together with a pie crust on top like a pot-pie. My family makes &#39;Meat Pie&#34; and it&#39;s like a Welsh pasti. A great deep dish meat pie made with potatoes, carrots and peas in a rich gravy. Lamb chicken or pork can be used in place of beef.

A great recipe for leftover meat! First meat pie I ever made, and will be sure to make it many more times. I didn&#39;t have veg/beef soup on hand, substituted it with condensed cream of tomato soup. Added a little water and some peas. I cooked the potatoes and carrots by themselves and then added to mixture.
