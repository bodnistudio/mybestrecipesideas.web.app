recipeingredient:
- "1 block Silken tofu"
- "2 Eggs separate the yolks and whites"
- "60 grams Sugar"
- "1 few drops Vanilla essence optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Before making the meringue, drain excess water from the tofu (simply set it on a plate to drain)."
- "Combine the egg whites and sugar in a bowl to make the meringue. Whip until stiff peaks form. (Refer to the Helpful Hints.)"
- "Add the drained tofu from Step 1 to the meringue. To make mixing easier, break apart the tofu with your hands as you add it to the mixture. Whip until the mixture becomes smooth."
- "Add the egg yolks and mix well. If you are using vanilla essence, mix in a few drops at the end."
- "Pour the mixture into a Tupperware container and place in the freezer. Mix the ice cream 2-3 times every hour until it&#39;s done. If you are freezing individual portions, then there&#39;s no need to mix them once they&#39;re in the freezer."

- "You can add your own touch to the ice cream. If desired, add other ingredients in Step 4. Some ingredients to consider are cocoa powder, kinako, chocolate, marshmallow, or boiled adzuki beans."
- "To make an ice cream sandwich, let the ice cream freeze for an hour, mix it, then sandwich a tablespoon of it between two biscuits, wrap it in cling film, then set it in the freezer."
