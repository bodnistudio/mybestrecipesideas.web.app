##### The ingredients needed to make Cube Roll Steak with Ponzu (4 Ingredients):

1. Prepare 2 cube roll steaks, about 1.5-2 cm thick
1. Take 4 tbsp ponzu
1. Take 2 garlic, peeled, crushed, sliced thinly
1. Get 1 tbsp oil (I used sunflower oil)


In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Don&#39;t overcook cube steak, otherwise it&#39;ll become tough. Contrary to what you might think, cubing is a technique, not a cut of steak. Cubing is the process of running any tough cut of meat, be it beef, pork, venison or another protein, through a machine that cuts through tough sinew in a crosshatch pattern and gives the meat a cubed appearance and, thus, its name.
