recipeinstructions:

- "Add the flour (shifted), cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves and stir until soft dough forms. Do not overwork the dough.

- "Stir in the puree and sugar spice mixture."
- "Lastly, gradually stir in the evaporated milk and add in the vanilla."
- "Pour into the pie crust."
- "Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the filling is just about set. Mine did take slightly longer to just about set, about 35 minutes."
- "To make the topping while th pie is baking, combine flour, sugar, butter and ginger in a food processor."
- "Pluse until it becomes crumbly but do not over process as it will turn to dough."
- "Carefully add the topping to the pie and bake for another 30-40 minutes, until the crumb topping is golden brown."
- "Cool on wire rack, until its at room temperature."
- "Refrigerate until it&#39;s time to serve."
- "Add whipping cream or extra thick cream to each serving."
- "I had a fair bit of dough and filling left so I made a few individual ones so as not to waste it."
