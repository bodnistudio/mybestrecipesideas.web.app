<h3>Instructions to make Autumn Carrot Spice Cake:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease and flour a large bundt pan. I use softened unsalted butter and a pastry brush to slather an ample amount in all the nooks and crannies. Always tap out any excess flour..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Put the first ten ingredients (no flour) in a large mixing bowl. Mix well with a whisk. This is what I call a slough..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon just until mixed. Do not over mix..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Transfer batter to prepared bundt pan using a rubber spatula/spoon. Tap pan on counter to ensure there are no air pockets..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place cake on center rack of oven to bake 55-60 minutes. Cake will test with a pick..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Remove cake from oven and cool on a rack for 15 minutes, then remove from pan and finish cooling on rack..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Make the frosting by placing all the frosting ingredients in a medium bowl and mixing well with a wooden spoon..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Frost the cooled cake with the frosting using a butter knife..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Sprinkle a little pumpkin pie spice on top of cake for decoration..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Serves 12 generously. Keeps at room temp on a cake plate with a dome..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Note: If you wish, you can add up to one cup nuts to the cake batter. Add them when you add the flour. Walnuts would be my choice here. If you have a convection oven reduce temp to 325 and bake the same amount of time..
			
			
		</li>
