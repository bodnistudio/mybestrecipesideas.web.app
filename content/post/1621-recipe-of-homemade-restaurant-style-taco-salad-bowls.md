The best thing about eating a taco salad at a restaurant is the crunchy tortilla bowl. A few days ago, I posted a Fried Shell Taco Salad recipe and it seemed like it was a big hit. After all, who doesn&#39;t like fried tortilla bowls? I&#39;m a bit embarrassed to admit how much I love fried foods: fries, cake, ice cream (best thing EVER), egg rolls.
