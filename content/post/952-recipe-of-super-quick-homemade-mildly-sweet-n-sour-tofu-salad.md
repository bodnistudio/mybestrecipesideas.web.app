I recommend tripling or quadrupling the sauce recipe if you want that true restaurant type of sweet and sour that drips with sauce. I added peanuts and chopped scallions skipped the bell pepper. Repeat this step with the rest of the tofu and cornstarch. Cook the tofu cubes in a skillet with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil over medium-high heat until all sides are golden brown. Tofu is a great substitute for those who are on a vegan or vegetarian diet.
