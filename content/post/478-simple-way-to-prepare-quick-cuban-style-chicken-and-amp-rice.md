##### The ingredients needed to make Cuban-Style Chicken &amp; Rice:

1. Take  olive oil for frying
1. Make ready  chicken thighs, skin on
1. Prepare  salt
1. Make ready  black pepper
1. Take  paprika
1. Prepare  poultry seasoning

Place the chicken in a container large enough to hold all the pieces (I used an extra-large zip-loc bag). Mojo (pronounced mo-ho) is a Cuban marinade and sauce that typically includes oil, garlic, cilantro, salt, and sometimes hot peppers such as jalapeno. But the hallmark of the sauce is the heavy emphasis on citrus, particularly sour orange. Pat the chicken dry and season with salt and pepper.

Melt the butter with the oil in a large deep skillet, with a lid over medium-high heat. Mojo marinade is fantastic to use for shrimp, chicken, pork and beef, cooked in all manner of ways - stove, BBQ, roasting, broiling. The only method I do not recommend is the slow cooker or Instant Pot because this type of marinade really benefits from caramelisation of some form throughout most of the cooking time. Add broth, beans, and bacon; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then cover and transfer to oven.
