You can toss this spicy rice dish together in no time! Mexican rice is the anchor of many excellent Mexican spreads, and having recently posted our recipe for Chiles Rellenos, I&#39;m back with the perfect Mexican rice to go alongside. I&#39;m a big believer in the accoutrements that come with food—the sides, the sauces, the extras, the add-ons, the toppings—the trappings that make the dish a MEAL. Stir the vegetable juice, basil and garlic powder in the skillet and heat to a boil. This easy spicy rice is the perfect accompaniment to any type of curry, and is the ideal way to make plain rice more interesting.
