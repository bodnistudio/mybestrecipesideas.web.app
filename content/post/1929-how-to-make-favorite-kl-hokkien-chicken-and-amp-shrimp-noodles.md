Malaysia is a haven for the noodle lover and each city has its own local favorites. Today we are referring specifically to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. The first halal KL Hokkien Mee that I had which I really enjoyed was in a recreational club, in which the chef deftly replaced the flavours of pork with that of seafood and chicken, and so I&#39;ve always called halal KL Hokkien Mee, Golf Club Style Hokkien Mee.

A delicious plate of Hokkien Mee packs strong wok hei (which is usually achieved when cooked over charcoal) and just the right amount of sauces for the best flavours. KL version is different in that it uses Dark Soy Sauce, which gives it it&#39;s dark color. Whether you&#39;re a local or international, hokkien mee is a staple in KL. Over a month ago, a bad batch of noodles ruined my last attempt at making KL (that&#39;s Kuala Lumpur, in case you didn&#39;t know)-Style Hokkien Mee. Since my Mum is here visiting with us, we decided to make it again, this time verifying that the noodles were good.
