<h3>Instructions to make Easily Made with a Frozen Pie Crust! Peach &amp; Adzuki Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Remove the pie crust from the freezer and let it sit out for 10 minutes to return to room temperature..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Meanwhile, prepare the peaches. Remove the peaches from the can and drain the syrup. Cut into bite-sized pieces..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			After cutting the peaches, begin preheating the oven..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			When the pie crusts have softened, cut each sheet into half..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Line a baking tray with parchment paper and place the cut pie crusts on top. I used pie crusts with holes already poked through. If you&#39;re using crusts with no holes, use a fork to randomly poke some..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Just open the canned adzuki beans. We&#39;ll be using it straight from the can, so it&#39;s very convenient. 1 can is just enough for 1 package (4 sheets) of pie crusts..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Top the pie crusts from Step 5 with the adzuki beans and peaches, leaving the edges open..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Top all four crusts. If you use an extra amount of peaches, the sweet and sour taste will be so delicious!.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cut vertical slits in the remaining 4 pie crusts..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place on top of Step 8..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Press the edges together with a fork to hold them closed..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Make the egg yolk mixture and then brush the pies with it. This will make them shine after baked. You can use the remaining egg in something like miso soup..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place the pies on the top rack of a 200Â°C oven and bake for 15 minutes. Then move them to the bottom rack and bake for another 10 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Done!.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			The center looks like this!.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			You can arrange the shapes of the pies and sizes of the peaches to anything you want..
			
			
		</li>
