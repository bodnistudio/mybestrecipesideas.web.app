Reduce the heat to medium low and add the tomato paste, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, cinnamon, paprika and garlic."

Working with 1 tortilla at a time, grill, flipping once, until a little charred and firm, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a sheet pan and repeat with the other tortilla."
- "With both tortillas side by side on the sheet pan, divide the carrot salsa between the two, spreading to cover all but an outer 1/2-inch rim. Bake until the tortilla is firm and the edges are golden, 6 to 7 minutes."

- "Transfer both tlayudas to a cutting board and top each with the seed mix and herb salad. Slice into wedges and serve."
