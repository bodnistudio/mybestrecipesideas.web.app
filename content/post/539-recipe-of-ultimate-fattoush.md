Fattoush is a popular salad in Middle Eastern cuisine and especially in Lebanon. In Panzanella, though, just as with fattoush, the bread is folded into the salad and is meant to absorb the dressing. Fattoush is one of the most well known Middle Eastern salads and a standard dish on the &#39;mezza&#39; (small dishes) table. Quite a few years ago, I used to work at a bank in Troy, MI and there used to be a Lebanese restaurant called La Shish nearby.
