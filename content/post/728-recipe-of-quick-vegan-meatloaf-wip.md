With this recipe I share how to make a juicy succulent meat loaf for vegans, vegetarians and all to enjoy. In addition, you don&#39;t need to worry about the ratio of fat to lean meat.

I served with Red Mashed Potatoes (whipped with only olive oil the starchy potato water and chicken or veg broth) and a Mushroom Gravy.
