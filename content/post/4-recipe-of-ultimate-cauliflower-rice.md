1. Cauliflower rice can be eating with either stew or sauce


In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger and white pepper; set aside. Microwave fresh cauliflower rice in a heatproof bowl, covered with cling film, for three minutes on High. If using from the freezer, microwave for four minutes on High, mixing the &#39;rice&#39; half way through cooking. This method gives the rice a nice, neutral flavour, perfect for serving with a curry or tagine.. Cauliflower rice made this way makes a great side dish on its own, seasoned simply with butter, salt, pepper, and perhaps some cheese, but for a white rice alternative, the microwaved rice was the.
