That is to say that crab and any form of tomato play well together, from a simple salad with freshly chopped tomatoes to this spaghetti with crab sauce. Cook spaghettini in boiling, salted water until al dente. Loaded with lump crab meat, tender shrimp and tossed in a buttery, tart, lemony sauce made with OLD BAYÂ® Seasoning and Flying DogÂ® Dead Rise OLD BAYÂ® Gose, it&#39;s the stuff dinnertime dreams are made of. Use canned crab labeled &#34;white crab meat&#34; in this Garlic Butter Crab Pasta.

The ones labeled &#34;pink crab meat&#34; are crab claw meat, and have a lot of tiny shell pieces that are impossible to pick out. The butter absorbs into the pasta pretty quickly, if you want more of a buttery crab pasta melt additional butter to mix into the pasta. Seafood pasta is such a treat, and these delicious recipes really hero the natural sweetness of crab. Such a beautiful thing - loaded up with white and brown meat - crab pasta recipes should be a celebration of fresh flavours and simplicity. Return the pasta to the pot, return to medium heat, add the remaining oil mixture and toss to coat thoroughly.
