		Crisp, baked sweet potato rounds piled high with spicy hummus, black bean and corn salsa, cilantro and jalapeños.
	
		Roasting the potatoes does slow down the process, so I recommend roasting extra sweet potatoes one night for dinner and using the left overs for this recipe the next day.
	
		Sweet potato hummus recipe made in a food processor.
	
		Perfect for dipping veggies and pita chips, or as a sandwich spread.
