The potato filling inside of this sandwich isn&#39;t technically the same one I use to stuff samosas, but in my house we still refer to this as the &#34;samosa grilled cheese.&#34; Generally I don&#39;t care for potatoes (except buttery cheese loaded mashed potatoes) but I swear I could eat a dozen of these! Make your ham and cheese sandwich as simple or as advanced as your heart desires! Potato Chips - I like to serve chips because there is no work involved. Just open the bag and jump in. If you grill it too quickly, the bread will burn before the cheese melts.
