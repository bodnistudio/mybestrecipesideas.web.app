How to Select and Trim a Red Cabbage: Select a red cabbage the same way you would select a green one - with tight and crisp, un-damaged leaves. Limp leaves or damage that extends past the first leaf can indicate a bad cabbage. To Trim a Cabbage, peel back and discard the outer leaves even if they look good (because they&#39;ve been on the grocery shelf). Cut the red cabbage in half, lengthwise.
