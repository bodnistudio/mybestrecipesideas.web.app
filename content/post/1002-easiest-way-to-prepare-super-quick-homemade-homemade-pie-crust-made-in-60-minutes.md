</p>

<h3>The ingredients needed to make Homemade Pie Crust Made In 60 Minutes:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>{Take  of All-Purpose Flour (or 100g cake flour + 100g bread flour). </li>

		<li>{Make ready  of Milk. </li>
	
</ol>
<p>
	
</p>

<h3>Instructions to make Homemade Pie Crust Made In 60 Minutes:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Dice the butter into 1 - 2 cm cubes. Measure the milk and place in the refrigerator. Put the flour into a bowl and add the diced butter..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Smash the butter into the flour using the back of a spoon. It&#39;s okay if it doesn&#39;t mix all together. Time is crucial! This step takes about 1 - 2 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the milk and mix in gently without kneading. When it looks clumpy and grainy like the picture, then it&#39;s good to go..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Just like that, wrap it in plastic wrap, form it into a square, and chill in the freezer for 20-30 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Dust with flour and use a rolling pin to stretch out the crust. It will break and split in places, but don&#39;t worry about that. The first time you roll it out, if it looks broken up like in the photo, it&#39;s fine..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			It&#39;s more or less fine to leave the breaks there. Forcibly fold the dough three times over itself. Dust with more flour, and roll out with a rolling pin again. You should repeat this step 5 - 6 times..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			If the dusted flour depletes and/or the butter melts too much, place in the freezer for 20 minutes to chill, then try again. If the room temperature is 28°C, you can make it to the end without resting..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Roll out the crust to 5 mm thick, sprinkle the surface with sugar and make into your preferred shape. Bake for 13 - 15 minutes at 210°C, and then it&#39;s finished..
			
			
		</li>
