recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all ingredients in a large glass bowl and get your hands in it! Mush it all up. Don&#39;t lick your hands! LOL Pre-heat oven now, to 350 degrees F, rack in middle."
- "Use a medium sized 12 muffin tin. With the bacon in the ground game meat, coating the tin is probably not necessary. Fill each muffin spot evenly, about right to the top."
- "Bake on middle rack at 350 F for 30 minutes. Take out to cool."
- "Serve with your favorite BBQ sauce, dip, and/or condiments, but really, these taste so good and are so moist, they don&#39;t need any!"
- "Assuming a 50/50 ratio of game to bacon when ground, each MMM = 225 cal, 18 fat (5.8 sat), 13.5 protein, 1.2 net carbs. You can reduce the fat by reducing the bacon and replacing more game meat. You also get more protein this way. The wild game meat is around 496 cal, 8 fat, 100 protein, and 0 carb per pound! Sweet! ðŸ¤—"
