recipeingredient:
- "1/2 pound baby fish I used smelt You could also use baby anchovy or similar baby fish"
- "3/4-1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/3 cup flour"
- "1/3 cup corn or potato starch"
- "3 cups vegetable oil for frying"
- "1 fresh lemon or lime"
- " Youll also need a frying basket or straining type of gadget"
recipeinstructions:
- "Soak the fish in ice water for 20 minutes or so. This will keep it from getting overcooked and tough. Then drain thoroughly.  At this point, you&#39;ll want to heat start pre-heating your oil in a deep saute pan or pot (or in my case, a wok) over medium-high-ish heat to somewhere between 350 to 375F."
- "Season the fish with salt and give it a few gentle tosses.  Prep a wide bowl or plate with paper towels/paper bags/ or newsprint to soak up the oil and set it near the frying station."
- "While the fish absorbs the seasoning, mix flour and starch in a tray or dish with sides. By this time, your oil should be ready.  If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, you can check the readiness by putting a pinch of the flour mixture into the oil and if it starts gently sizzling right away, it&#39;s ready."
- "Toss a third of the fish in the flour and starch mixture, shake off most of the excess, and gently lower into the oil. (Do not drop from a distance or hot oil will splatter on you.)"
- "Fry for 3.5 to 4 minutes, or until golden brown, giving it a stir or two halfway just to make sure everything gets evenly cooked."
- "Fish* (pun intended :P) the fish out, let it drain for a few second on the side of your cooking vessel, then set it aside in your dish.  Repeat Steps 4 and 5 two more times with the other two thirds of the fish."
- "Serve with fresh lemon to squeeze over the fish right before eating. Enjoy! :)"
