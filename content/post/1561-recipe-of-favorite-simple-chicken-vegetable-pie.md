<h3>Instructions to make Simple Chicken Vegetable Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Preheat oven to 425Â°F..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Combine flour, salt and flour in mixing bowl. Add in oil and milk. Mix thoroughly, then set aside..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Heat oil in a deep frying pan at medium-high heat. Add chicken, cook until chicken is no longer pink..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add flour one tablespoon at a time, mixing so that it thoroughly coats the  chicken and absorbs the oil. Also add seasoning at this time..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add milk slowly, mixing thoroughly as you do. It should start thickening into gravy as it mixes with the floured chicken..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add vegetables to the  chicken gravy. Allow gravy to cook until vegetables defrost, stirring frequently..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In your baking dish, take about half of the dough you made previously and press it evenly into the bottom of the dish. Bake in oven for 5-10 minutes, or until the crust just starts to turn brown (I usually do this while I&#39;m preparing the filling) Remove from oven..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Scoop/pour the filling into the baking dish on top of the crust..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Flatten the remaining dough out evenly and lay it over the filling so that it covers it (It doesn&#39;t have to be perfect, as the crust usually pulls away from the edges a bit anyway)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place in oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is a golden brown..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Remove from oven and serve! If you allow it to sit and cool for a few minutes before serving, its usually a little easier to scoop out, as the filling thickens a little as it cools. Enjoy!.
