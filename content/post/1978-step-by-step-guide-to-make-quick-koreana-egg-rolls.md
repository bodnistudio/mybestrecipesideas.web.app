recipeingredient:
- "1 pound pork butt"
- "5 oz small size shrimp"
- " Salt sugar pepper"
- "3 TBS oyster sauce"
- "1 1/4 of a medium onion"
- "1 medium and 1 small carrot"
- "2/3 of a green squash"
- "2 small stalks of celery"
- " For dipping sauce"
- "1/2 cup vinegar"
- "1/2 cup sugar"
- "3 TBS ketchup"
- "1/2 TBS salt"
- "1 TBS chili garlic sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut meat and shrimp in small cubes. Sprinkle some salt, pepper and sugar. Mix well. Do not mix shrimp with meat. Their cooking time is different."
- "Cut vegetables the same size as meat."
- "Stir fry meat and shrimp separately. Put in mixing bowl."
- "Stir fry the vegetables. Add salt and pepper. Remove into mixing bowl with shrimp and meat. Cool for a couple of hours in fridge. After 2 hours, add 3 TBS of oyster sauce. Mix well and let it rest for 30 minutes."
- "Put mixture in a colander to strain excessive seasoning. This process will make the egg rolls crispier and will also prevent oil from “splashing” because of seasoning leaking out from rolls."
- "On a sheet of egg roll, with water, use fingers to wet all borders of the sheet, put fillings in middle. Fold up right and left side to cover filling. Then roll the side close to you towards the opposite side to make one egg roll."
- "Use another sheet and wrap a second time (for very thin wrap). I do not use double sheets. When you do so, oil can get in between 2 sheets when frying because the sheets are not sealed. That will make the egg rolls oily."
- "Fry in hot oil (medium heat) for 1mn 40 seconds for each side. Remove on paper towel. Before eating, fry a second time for crunchiness. Medium heat, 2 minutes for each side."
- "For dipping sauce: put all ingredients for sauce in saucepan. Stir and bring to boil on medium heat. Reduce heat to medium low. Simmer to reduce to 2/3."

And they look much nicer too. These Korean Egg Rolls are one of the best things that has ever happened to me. Slightly sweet, umami packed ground beef, deep fried in an egg roll wrapper, then served with the most perfect gochujang dipping sauce. We love to use Korean gochujang in dishes like these Korean Pork Bulgogi Tacos, these Spicy Cauliflower Wings and Korean Beef Nachos. Mix a raw egg in a small bowl or cup, or use a small bowl of water.
