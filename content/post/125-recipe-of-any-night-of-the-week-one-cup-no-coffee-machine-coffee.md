A single-serve coffee maker gives you the convenience of making one cup of coffee at a time just the way you like it. Pop in your favorite coffee pod, press a button or two, and you&#39;re ready to go. We can&#39;t say if this is the best dual coffee maker with a single-serve coffee system, but no one can&#39;t deny that it has been one of the top-selling products for years. Larger single-cup coffee makers often feature a water reservoir that you need to fill only when it&#39;s empty. If you like a little fancier cup of coffee, look for a one-cup coffee maker that includes a milk frother for making coffee-house-style specialty coffees like cappuccinos or lattes.
