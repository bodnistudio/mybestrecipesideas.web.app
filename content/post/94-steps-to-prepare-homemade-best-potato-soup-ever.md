recipeinstructions:
- "In the vessel you are going to make your soup in, Cook diced bacon until extra crisp, remove and drain excess fat from vessel. (I reserve about a tablespoon of grease to add back at the end!)"
- "Add cubed potatoes, onion, carrot, seasonings and chicken broth. Bring to a simmer, cover for 15 minutes or until potatoes are fork tender"
- "While the soup is simmering, mix the milk and flour until well incorporated. I actually use an immersion blender (stick blender). Make sure heat is low. Add SLOWLY to soup mixture. I actually temper the milk by adding some hot broth to it first before adding the whole thing in to prevent the milk from curdling."
- "Slowly increase heat to medium, stirring on a regular. Once the soup has hit a higher SIMMER, NOT boil, stir constantly for 2 minutes to thicken. This prevents it from &#34;breaking.&#34;"
- "Add the cubed processed cheese and bacon back to soup, stir until cheese is melted. Top with green onions if you&#39;d like and serve!"
- "** got from taste of home, winning recipes*** also, I have used real cheese, and it is good, just not as creamy. :)"
- "I also add about a tablespoon of bacon grease back to the soup when I add the cheese and bacon back! Adds great flavor!"
