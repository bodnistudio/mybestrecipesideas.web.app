A kehwa (tea base) is first prepared with Kashmiri or Green Tea leaves and whole spices like star anise, cinnamon, cloves and green cardamon. And then the kehwa is boiled with milk and sugar to make the tea. Apart from Soda, Salt is also added to Pink Tea and hence it is called Noon Chai. I prefer to add little Sugar along with the salt. The Tea leaves used in making pink tea is not the typical tea leaves but Kashmiri Kahwa Green Tea (please see below the link for buying the tea).
