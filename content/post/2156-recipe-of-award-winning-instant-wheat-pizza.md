All-purpose flour works well if that&#39;s what you have on hand. Salt gives my whole wheat pizza crust a little flavor. Pizza dough without salt tastes bland regardless of the toppings. I add a touch of honey to my whole wheat pizza dough recipe for flavor.

If you have some on hand, I recommend using bread flour (along with the white whole wheat) in your pizza dough. Bread flour has a higher gluten content, which gives your pizza crust a chewier texture. Make a simple, easy (and vegan!) homemade whole wheat pizza dough using whole wheat flour, yeast, salt, water, and vegetable oil. To keep it truly vegan, be sure to use sugar in place of the honey, particularly if you&#39;re cooking for other vegans, as some vegans strictly avoid honey. How to make easy whole wheat pizza dough: This one is simple, friends: Swap the all purpose flour for whole wheat flour, or part of the all purpose flour for part whole wheat flour.
