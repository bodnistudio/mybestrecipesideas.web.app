recipeinstructions:
- "In a large sauce pan, heat the butter and oil together then drop in your onions then your garlic. Saut√© until onions are translucent. Drop in your diced or minced bell pepper. Continue saut√©ing."
- "Bacon! Who doesn&#39;t love bacon? This will also make your sauce tastier."

This Bolognese sauce is dedicated to the late great Marcella Hazan. She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food, and at a time when most Americans thought &#39;Bolognese&#39; was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger, Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be. In a large dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat oil. Stir in beef and garlic, breaking up meat with back of a spoon. Sometimes you just want the works: A hefty bowl of pasta with the heartiest meat sauce you can dream up.
