Flip the chicken over and add the butter, thyme sprigs and garlic to the pan. Fry for another 6 to 8 minutes. As the butter melts, spoon it over the chicken. When cooked, remove the chicken to a plate to rest for 5 minutes."
- "Serve the chicken with a generous drizzle of the gastrique and a sprinkle of the delicate thyme leaves."
