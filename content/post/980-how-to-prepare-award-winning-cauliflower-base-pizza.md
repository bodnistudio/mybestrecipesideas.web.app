recipeinstructions:
- "Blend your cauliflower until rice-like. Add the almond meal, chia seeds, oregano, chilli and water and blend until smooth(ish)."
- "Use a baking tray or pizza tray. Cover with non-stick baking paper and a light layer of vegetable oil. Pour over the blended cauliflower and smooth out with the back of a spoon. Thickness depends on how thick you like your pizza! I prefer a thinner base, which also cooks more quickly in the oven."
- "Bake at 180 degrees for approx 7 minutes, then remove from the oven and flip the base over. This is a bit tricky - I find that the easiest way is to slide the base off of the tray using the baking paper. Put a new later of baking paper down and then turn the base upside down onto the new sheet of paper. This is the easiest way to turn the base without it breaking!"
- "Bake for another 5-7 minutes, until the base starts to crisp."
- "Now remove from the oven and add your tomato puree, chopped tomatoes and mozzarella cheese."
- "Return to the oven for a couple of minutes, until the cheese is beginning to melt. Then add your other toppings - I like chorizo (finely sliced), ham and pineapple. Spread these evening over your base and top with grated cheddar."
- "Return to the oven, but this time on grill setting. Grill until your toppings begin to crisp. Remove from the oven and ENJOY!"
