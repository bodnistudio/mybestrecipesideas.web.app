Back by popular request, I&#39;ll talk a little bit about the country like I used to. You&#39;ll notice the egg binding the grounds together in clumps, which is completely normal. Turn into coffee pot; pour on boiling water, and stir. (I remember the ladies adding the coffee/egg mixture directly to the boiling water.) Optional: The spout of the pot can be stuffed with soft paper towel to prevent escape of the fragrant aroma. While the water is boiling, crack the egg (with the shell) into a cup and stir. Add the ground coffee to the egg and stir some more.
