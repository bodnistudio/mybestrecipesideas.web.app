Bacon grease is melted and heated. Bobby Deen lightens up classic Southern grits by cooking them in low-sodium chicken broth instead of cream or whole milk (this trick also adds savory depth). And he replaces traditional pork sausage with turkey kielbasa, which is lower in calories and saturated fat but still delivers smoky and meaty flavor. Traeger&#39;s breakfast biscuits with smoked sausage gravy features homemade biscuits that are covered in a white gravy with smoked sausage. Brown sliced sausage in skillet and add a little water.
