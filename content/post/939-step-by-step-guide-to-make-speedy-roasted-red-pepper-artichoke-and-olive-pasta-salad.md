I have a propensity for lemon and increase the amount of zest and juice. As a matter of fact, I increase the feta and basil as well! Add the cooled corn, roasted red peppers, arugula, basil, and crushed red pepper (if using) to the bowl with the pasta. Add half of the goat cheese and gently toss again. Taste and season with a little extra salt and pepper if needed.
