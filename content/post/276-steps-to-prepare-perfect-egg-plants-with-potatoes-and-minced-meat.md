I wanted to share this eggplant tomato ground beef skillet recipe on the blog because it&#39;s the easiest way I&#39;ve found to use up our Asian eggplants. I cook a lot of easy ground beef skillet recipes throughout the year. We all know that grass fed beef is the best, but I don&#39;t buy it because we stock our freezer with ground venison burger meat. Drain in a colander or on paper towels. Place a heavy casserole or bowl on top of the eggplant, pressing down to squeeze out excess water.
