Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap and cloth towel. Being a pizza blogger helped chip away at my aversion over time. I learned how to make caramelized onions years ago, and now I even enjoy (very thin) slices of red onion on the occasional tuna fish sandwich. In fact, today, onions (raw and cooked) rank solidly in the middle of my list of favorite pizza toppings! Made for carnivores, this three-meat pizza is balanced with sweet caramelized onions and roasted red peppers.
