recipeinstructions:
- "First, the beauty of sushi is you can put whatever you like in. It. I’m vegetarian and usually make sushi after I’ve made a tofu dish, and use the leftover tofu in it! So whatever you have on hand, utilise!"
- "Cook the sushi rice according to package. If possible, make a day ahead! It needs to cool down before you use it. If using on the day, after cooked, spread on cooking sheet and chill for an hour. The key to sushi rice is that it’s sticky. Most groceries sell this."
- "Cut roasted sweet potato into thin strips. Do the same with avocado and cucumber."
- "Time to assemble. Use a sushi mat (or if you don’t have one, get a large piece of cling film on counter). And place nori sheet on top."
- "Get your hands wet and scoop and press down rice to almost fill the sheet. Wet hands ensure the rice doesn’t stick to you. Leave about a half inch of space free at the top."
- "Place vegetables close to the bottom edge in a row and stack them, like the photo shows."
- "Lift the edge of the cling film closest to the vegetables while holding the nori and start to roll. You want to hold the ingredients in place while you tightly roll. You can pull the cling film at the end while you roll in to tighten. Continue rolling until the roll is fully complete. (Watch a video online to get a better idea!)"
- "Get a sharp knife and cut into pieces. Serve with soy sauce and sriracha."
