As a matter of fact, I increase the feta and basil as well! Made a few alterations though: Feta cheese instead of mozzarella for a bigger taste Added some chicken sauteed in olive oil with some dried oregano sprinkled on Added some red pepper flakes Didn&#39;t even end up using the olives b/c was so good without but am sure the olives add a nice touch and imagine capers would as well. Cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a blender, add the oil, vinegar, basil, Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper; cover and process until blended. Drain and rinse pasta in cold water; place in a large bowl.
