Dark soy sauce: The addition of molasses and a bit of cornstarch gives a sweeter, more full-bodied flavor and a syrupy consistency to dark soy sauce. Rice vinegar: Mild, not pungent, and relatively sweet. I added fresh garlic and minced red pepper for a surprise of color inside. AND, since my restaurant is a &#34;no-fry&#34; zone, I had to bake the rice balls - and they turned out perfectly! I gave them a nice coating of bread crumbs and then baked them on an oiled sheet till browned and crispy.
