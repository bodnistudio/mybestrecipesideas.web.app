- "Add the rice and stir this in and cook for a few minutes."
- "Add 1/4 of the stock into the pan. Stir and cook the rice for a few minutes then add a pinch of saffron and the rest of the stock."

- "A further 15 minutes, the moisture in the pan should have been fully soaked up by the rice and the seafood on top should have been cooked. The paella should be ready to eat."
- "You may have noticed that I haven’t added any salt or pepper. This is because my parents have to lower their salt intake and I let them pepper the dish afterwards to their own liking."
