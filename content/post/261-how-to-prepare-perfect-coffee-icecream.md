1. Combine the cornflour and 1/2cup of milk.
1. Boil 2 1/2 cups of milk and sugar on a slow flame stirringly for 10 min.

In a medium sized mixing bowl (or in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), add the cold heavy whipping cream and instant coffee. Regular coffee waters down the mixture too much, and the ice cream doesn&#39;t hold. This doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t get a decent freeze-dried coffee from your favorite producer and region. With only four ingredients and some time to let the ice cream set, you&#39;ll have in your hands a smooth, tasty coffee ice cream that can compete with the most. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise with a sharp paring knife.
