- "In a medium bowl, beat egg yolks and sugar until creamy and lightened in color."
- "Add milk, oil, and flour. Mix until combined."
- "Separate half of the batter into another medium bowl. Add cocoa powder to one of them and mix until combined."
- "Beat egg white in a clean medium bowl until frothy. Add cream of tartar or lemon juice if using (optional). Either one of these acidic ingredients will help stabilize the beaten egg white."
- "Gradually add sugar as you mix. Beat until stiff peak."
- "Add 1/4 of beaten egg white/meringue into the non-chocolate batter. Mix thoroughly with a whisk or silicone spatula."

- "Add 1/4 of the meringue into the chocolate batter. Mix thoroughly. Then add the rest of the meringue and slowly mix again just until combined."
- "Line the cupcake tray with paper cups. Then alternately add chocolate and non-chocolate batter into each cup until almost full, leaving about 1 cm from the top."
- "Decorate the top with any marble pattern that you like. I add three dots of different color on top. Then use a toothpick to drag through each dot with one continuous round stroke."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 340째F or 170째C for 20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean."
