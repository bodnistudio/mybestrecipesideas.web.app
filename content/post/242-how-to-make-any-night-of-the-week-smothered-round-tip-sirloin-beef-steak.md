This makes the cooking process a little shorter as the pieces become tender faster. One hour of simmer was all it took me for my steak to tenderize. Thicker cuts of beef will require the longer cooking time, so adjust accordingly. You&#39;ll see that slowly baking the beef in liquid helps to retain moisture in the meat and gives the tough fibers time to break down and soak up all of the delicious flavors of the seasoning.
