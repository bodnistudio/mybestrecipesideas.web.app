While the pan heats, roughly chop the mushrooms, then add them along with the olive oil. This rich, creamy pasta sauce was the result of an experiment. We wanted to make a creamy, mushroom-y pasta topping with no cream. We&#39;re trying to watch our diet a little better, and while we were eating pasta there was no need to indulge in cream, right? The creaminess and thickness in a sauce can come through many methods.
