One of my go-to soup recipes and a reader favorite! It&#39;s such a creamy and comforting soup. Just be sure not to leave off the cheddar and bacon (or ham), they add lots of flavor! There&#39;s no creamy dressing on a vinegar-based potato salad like Dill Potato Salad. This type of salad is quite different from the one with a creamy base, but it is also served cold.
