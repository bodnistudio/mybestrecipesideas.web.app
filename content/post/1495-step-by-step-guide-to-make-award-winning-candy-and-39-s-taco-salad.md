This is a quick-to-throw-together taco salad that even picky family members will eat, as you can serve any of the ingredients on the side. I sometimes serve with taco shells and let my five-year-old make tacos out of the ingredients (minus the dressing for the salad). Spoon beef mixture into taco shells; top with salad mixture. Serve with cheese and sour cream if desired. My kids and husband ate their taco salad with the tortilla chips but I had mine with just lettuce tomatoes a tablespoon of reduced fat sour cream and homemade salsa.
