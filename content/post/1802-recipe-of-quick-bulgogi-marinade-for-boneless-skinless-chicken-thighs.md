recipeingredient:
- "4 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs"
- "1/2 a small apple finely grated using a microplane or fine cheese grater or you can use 14 cup apple sauce"
- "1.5-2 Tablespoons minced garlic about 3 or 4 large cloves"
- "1/3 cup white sugar"
- "1/4 cup mirin"
- "1/3 cup  2 Tablespoons soy sauce"
- "2 Tablespoons toasted sesame oil"
- "2 green onions chopped green and white parts"
- " optional 12 teaspoon ground ginger or 15 teaspoons minced fresh ginger root"
recipeinstructions:
- "I usually just throw everything into a large mixing bowl and get in there with my hands, gently tossing and massaging until all the seasonings are evenly distributed.  If you prefer, you can mix all the marinade ingredients in a separate bowl, stir or whisk until all the sugar is dissolved, and then pour it over the chicken thighs and mix."
- "I like to marinate it for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. Right around 6 to 8 hours is the sweet spot for me, where all the chicken takes on great flavor, but the texture of the meat hasn&#39;t taken on cured qualities and is tender, juicy, and still chicken-y. :)"
- "Because it is dark and somewhat fatty meat, you&#39;ll want to grill over a medium low heat for 5 to 7 minutes per side, depending on the size of the thigh piece. Watch for flareups as the caramelized marinade mixed with the melting chicken fat hits the coals."
- "Enjoy!"
