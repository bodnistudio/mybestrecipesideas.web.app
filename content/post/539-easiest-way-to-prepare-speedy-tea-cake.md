To Southerners of a certain age, tea cakes are the embodiment of a grandmother&#39;s warm kitchen in the dead of winterâ€¦or a carefree summer afternoon spent barefoot and running through the sprinkler in the front yard. These little cakes look like cookies, but the texture is more cakey and soft, although not exactly the texture of a cake either. There were nine children in our family and Mother had to stretch the budget, so she made these often for dessert. I loved them when I was a child, and they&#39;re still a special treat. In fact, I&#39;ve never met anyone who doesn&#39;t like these cookies.
