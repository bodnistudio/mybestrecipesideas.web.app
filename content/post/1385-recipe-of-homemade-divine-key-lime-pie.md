<h3>Steps to make Divine Key Lime PieÂ ðŸ’š:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Start here if you&#39;re making the crust yourself. For a store-bought crust, skip to step 9.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Melt the butter and allow to cool..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a large food processor or blender, combine the graham crackers, sea salt, and sugar..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Mix them up for around 30 seconds..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the butter and continue mixing it until it&#39;s uniform. If it looks really watery add another graham cracker or two..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			For the pie, your pan should be ~20cm. If you have a pie pan or springform pan, then skip this step. Otherwise if you&#39;re using a cake pan, press aluminium foil inside to the edges. This will allow us to lift the pie out easier later..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Push your graham cracker mixture into the bottom and edge of the pan, and don&#39;t worry about getting your hands dirty :) Then put the crust in the fridge for 10 minutes. (Don&#39;t use cling-film on the top, or it will steam).
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Take out of the fridge, and bake at 190C (~320F) for 15 minutes ^3^.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Separate the eggs, and save the yolks. You can use the whites for something else later..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In your food processor/ blender blend the filling ingredients (condensed milk, egg yolks, lime juice, lime zest), scraping the sides every 5 seconds or so. (Until it&#39;s smooth).
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Wait for the crust to have cooled down from the oven, and then pour your filling on top of the crust..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake in the oven for 14 minutes at 160C (320F). When it&#39;s ready the filling will be a little jiggly, but not wet. Add a minute or two if necessary..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Remove from the oven, and allow it to cool for 10-15 minutes, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours (cover with cling-film in the fridge this time)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			At this point, it&#39;s ready to eat, but you can add the whipped cream topping as well for more deliciousness. (Recommended!).
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Mix the icing sugar and the cream in a bowl, and beat for several minutes until the cream is firm, and holds its shape when you remove the beaters.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Spread evenly over the top of the pie, and enjoy on a hot summer day ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¥§.
			
			
		</li>
