Hey everyone, it's Brad, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, easy potato leek soup. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Potato leek soup, or potage parmentier, is a French classic. It&#39;s one of the first dishes I learned to make in culinary school, right after a proper omelet, because it&#39;s an essential base soup in French cuisine. Add watercress for potage au cresson, serve it chilled for Vichyssoise — or top it with bacon.

##### The ingredients needed to make Easy Potato Leek Soup:

1. Take 2 leeks, white and pale green parts only, washed and chopped
1. Take 1/2 cup onion, chopped
1. Prepare 4 chives, chopped
1. Take 2 clove garlic, diced
1. Make ready 2 tbsp butter
1. Take 6 large potatoes, peeled and cubed
1. Take 4 cup low sodium chicken broth
1. Prepare 1 cup half and half
1. Take 1 shredded cheddar cheese to taste
1. Make ready 1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley

This potato leek soup is heavy on the leeks, with just enough potato to give the soup its signature creamy texture. This is a recipe you can assemble in the slow cooker and leave for the whole day, coming home to the sweet, earthy, caramel perfume of long-cooked leeks and potato. This version is almost identical to the full-blown version, with the exception that rather than pressing the potatoes through a ricer, you just dump all of the ingredients into a blender, blending it just until puréed (the more you blend it the gluier it becomes). Cream is added to potatoes and leeks cooked in chicken broth in this simple, easy-to-prepare soup.
