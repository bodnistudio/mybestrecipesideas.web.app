Mint chocolate chip is an ice cream flavor composed of mint ice cream with small chocolate chips. In some cases the liqueur cr√®me de menthe is used to provide the mint flavor. For a mint ice cream, you can go the route of steeping real mint leaves in the cream, or you can use mint extract. I&#39;m sure the steeping option is a great method and all, but it takes quite a bit of mint and an extra hour of steeping time.
