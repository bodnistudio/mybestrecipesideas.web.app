recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 375°F. Grease a 9x13&#34; baking pan very well and set it aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk and seasonings and set it aside. Next get the olive oil heating up in a large skillet over medium heat."

Then add the zucchini and cook just a few more minutes, until it&#39;s all tender."
- "Sprinkle the veggies evenly over the top of the sausage and sprinkle the cheese over the top of that. Pour the egg mixture over all of it. Bake for 21-25 minutes, until it&#39;s puffy and the center is set. Then remove it from the oven and let it sit a few minutes before slicing it up and serving it."
