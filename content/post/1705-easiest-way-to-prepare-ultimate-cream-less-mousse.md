recipeinstructions:

- "Beat yolks until pale. About 3 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, dissolve the sugar in the strong coffee over low heat on the stove until clear and no more granules are present."
- "Dribble the hot coffee syrup into the yolks while constantly stirring with a whisk to avoid scrambling the eggs."
- "using the same pan as the syrup was made in, combine the chocolate and the flavoring. With steaming water, create a double boiler off the stove top. You would do this by heating up water in a separate sauce pan then placing the chocolate and flavoring bowl into it to bathe and indirectly heat the mixture. Cover with a lid and set aside."
- "Going back to the yolk mixture, beat it over a steaming double boiler for about Seven or eight minutes until warm to the touch, pale and fluffy. Avoid scrambling the eggs. Take it off the steam and beat it with an electric mixer until it&#39;s fluffy cool, and makes a thick ribbon when the mixer is lifted from the mixture."
- "Go back to the chocolate. It should be hot and soft. Whisk the lumps out of the chocolate and fully combine with the flavoring. Add the softened butter and stir until it melts. Fold this into the yolk custard."
- "Beat the whites on low speed for the electric mixture until foamy."
- "Add the salt and tartar."
- "Increase speed and beat whites until stable, stiff peaks form. It&#39;s beaten enough if you can safely and successfully perform the Blizzard test- hold the bowl upside down. If it defies gravity and doesn&#39;t soil your counter you can move on."
- "Dump the whites in top of the yolk mixture. Using a rubber spatula, cut down the center and fold the bottom on top. Turn the bowl and repeat. This minimizes deflating the whites and ensures the fluffiness mousse consistency."
