The frosting is an espresso buttercream. Topped with more mocha ganache and a Dark Chocolate Oreo, they&#39;re a delicious buzz of chocolate and espresso. Almost as good as the beverage I so fondly remember. Espresso Powder: I highly recommend this addition to deepen the chocolate and stout flavors, though you can leave it out in the cupcakes and frosting if necessary. In a large bowl, beat sugar, coffee, oil, eggs, vinegar and vanilla until well blended.
