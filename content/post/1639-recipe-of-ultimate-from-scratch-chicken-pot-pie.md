		The filling for this Quick Chicken Pot Pie is made from scratch and has no cream in it (most chicken pot pies do).
	
		The sauce is made with flour, milk and a bit of cheese instead of using a carton of cream.
	
		Leaving out cream is not a conscious decision I made for health reasons.

<h3>Instructions to make From Scratch Chicken Pot Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			bake the chicken at 350°F for about 2 hours (assuming a 3-4 pound bird), until internal temperature hits 165°F..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			While the chicken cooks, toss the giblets in 1 cup of flour, thoroughly coating them, waiting a minute or two, and then coating some more..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			On medium, heat the oil in a two quart saucepan, and then toss in the floured giblets..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Fry the giblets crispy on the outside, allowing them to erode as they stick to the bottom of the pan, and then break them up a bit to crisp them some more..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the rest of the flour, and then slowly add one cup of water, while stirring, to deglaze and mix.  It should paste quickly, so add, slowly the second cup of water, while stirring..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the onion, garlic, bay, salt, and pepper, and stir and simmer a few more minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the drippings from the chicken, and stir until incorporated..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Fish out the bits, and feed them to the dog..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the stick of butter, and, when melted in, stir in the cream, too..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the veggies, and cook soft..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Tear apart the chicken, and add as much chicken as the gravy can hold.  It should be about 3/4 of the chicken.  Stir, salt to taste, and turn off the heat once it&#39;s incorporated..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the fat, softened butter, crust flour, salt, and ice cold water in a mixing bowl, and mix..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Once the dough is mixed, break into two lumps, and roll out one.  Once rolled, roll the dough carefully back up with the rolling pin to ease the transition to the pan..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Unfurl the dough in a 9x17in casserole, and press out a bottom layer.  I know, blasphemy, right? It doesn&#39;t need to be perfect..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cook the bottom crust for about 10 minutes at 350°F..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Now add the filling to the bottom crust..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Roll out a top crust, and then roll up that crust, and then roll it out on top of the filling.  It&#39;s a pot pie; again, it doesn&#39;t need to be perfect..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			35 minutes at 350F, with another few minutes added at the end, at broil, to brown..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Let set for a few minutes at least, and then serve..
			
			
		</li>
	
</ol>

		With a homemade cream sauce, generous topping of cornbread, it is a comforting meal-in-one that can win over folks who may not care for more traditional chicken pot pie recipes.
	
		However, it comes together really easily and I will tell you that I&#39;ve always hated chicken pot pie - but I love this one.
