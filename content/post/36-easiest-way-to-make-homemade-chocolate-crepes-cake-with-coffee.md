For ganache, place chocolate in a small bowl. Delicious dessert however the crepe recipe didn&#39;t turn out for me. I ended up throwing out the batter and making my tried and true crepe recipe with the addition of instant coffee powder. I served these as I remember having crepes in South America:I put a spoonful of warm chocolate sauce on the crepe and then folded in half, and in half again. I&#39;ve done crepes before but these were hard to cook without being over or under done.
