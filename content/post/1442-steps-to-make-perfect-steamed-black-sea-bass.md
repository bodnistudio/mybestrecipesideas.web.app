- "1 Black Sea Bass Whole"
- "1/4 Cup Light Soy Sauce"

- "1 pc. Ginger"
- "2 Cloves Garlic"
- "2 Green Onions"
- "1 Small Pepper"
- " Salt"
- " Black Pepper"
- "2 Tbs Oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add about an inch of water to a large pan or pot. Pat excess moisture off of fish. Make two slashes on each side of the fish. Prep veggies as seen below. Brush fish with oil, season with salt, pepper and 2 Tsp. sugar inside and outside of the fish."
- "Fill slash cuts with with ginger, sliced green onion, garlic and some pepper. Whatever doesn’t fit, place into the cavity and on top of the fish. Reserve half the ends of the green onion to fill the cavity of the fish and the other half to place on top."
- "Mix soy sauce, vinegar and the remaining sugar. Pour over fish. I have opted to make a ring out of aluminum foil and place a pie pan on top of it to steam the fish. A small upside down plate may work as well. The point is to be close to the hot water, but not in it and to produce as much steam as possible. When your water has reached a boil, place the fish in."
- "Steam for 20 minutes and voilà. Pour accumulated juices on and around the fish. Use extreme caution when transferring fish from pan as it will be very tender and delicate."
