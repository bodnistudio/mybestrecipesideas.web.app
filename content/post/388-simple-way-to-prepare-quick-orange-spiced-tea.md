A food processor makes this effortless, but I managed with a blender for years, and have even stirred it together by hand when necessary-- although it&#39;s not quite as pretty when done that way. This beverage tastes even better, because you make it with brewed chai tea, real orange, lemon, and pineapple juices, and cinnamon sticks, fresh cloves, or mulling spices. Product Description For our Orange Spice tea we blend full-bodied black teas with the finest cinnamon, orange peel, and orange oil. The result is a very aromatic tea that has the flavor of zesty orange and spicy cinnamon.
