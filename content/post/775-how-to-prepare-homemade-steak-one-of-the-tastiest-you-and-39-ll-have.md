First, a definition: Steaks are basically any piece of meat that falls under the category of &#34;fast-cooking&#34; cuts—cuts that are low enough in connective tissue The further toward the head of the steer you get, the more of the spinalis muscle you&#39;ll find in your steak—that&#39;s the cap of meat that wraps around. Here&#39;s what you need: ribeye steak, salt, pepper, canola oil, butter, garlic, fresh rosemary, fresh thyme. Transfer the garlic and herbs on top of the steak and baste the steak with the butter using a large spoon. Once you learn how to salt a steak for maximum flavor, you&#39;ll ditch those seasoning bottles STAT. &#34;Salt releases moisture in the muscle [of the meat] and releases the natural flavors of steak,&#34; says There you have it folks, your next steak just got that much tastier, all thanks to the humble salt. Because steaks are one of the easiest foods you can cook yourself, you&#39;ll never find me at a steakhouse.
