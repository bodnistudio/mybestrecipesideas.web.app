- "Round up the dough and place in an oil-greased and large bowl. Cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Let sit for 1 hour or until doubled in size."
- "After the dough is doubled in size, punch it down to release the gas inside. Transfer onto work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces."
- "Roll each into a ball and place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Cover and let rise until doubled in size."
- "Brush each with an egg wash (lightly beaten egg). Bake in a preheated oven at 350째F (180째C) for 18-20 minutes. Then set aside on a cooling rack."
- "Filling: Stir everything until combined except the meat floss."
- "Version 1: Slice the bun to make a hamburger. Spread the filling on the inside. Put enough meat floss on the bottom half of bun. Then cover with the top half and enjoy."
- "Version 2: Brush the filling onto the bun. Put enough meat floss to cover the top, then enjoy. I prefer to assemble them right before serving as the filling needs to be chilled in the fridge if not eaten on the same day."
