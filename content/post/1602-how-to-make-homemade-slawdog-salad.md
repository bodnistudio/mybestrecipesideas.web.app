Pro tip: Before grilling, poach hot dogs in water or beer until warmed through. [â€¦] I have been eating these since my childhood. Normally I make these with leftover slaw so the ratio of slaw may be off. The dressing makes a wonderful dressing for coleslaw. You may have leftover dressing, it can also be served on a fruit salad or lettuce wedges.
