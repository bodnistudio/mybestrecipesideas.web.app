recipeinstructions:
- "Peel and chop the mangoes and add them in a blender or mixer jar."
- "Blend till smooth."
- "Then add sugar or powdered jaggery &amp; vanilla extract along with the mangoes in a blender. You can also use honey. I have made this ice cream both with sugar as well as powdered jaggery. Both ways the ice cream tastes good. You can also add sugar or jaggery when blending the mangoes."

- "Pour the ice cream mixture in a freezer proof container or box. Cover the container tightly with a lid. Even the top with a spatula."
- "Keep the ice cream in the freezer for a few hours till it is half set. Remove and add the ice cream to a blender jar or in a bowl."
- "Whip again till smooth and you see the volume increasing. You can also whip in a blender or food processor. Then pour in the same container and freeze till set. Remember to cover the container with a lid. You can also whip the ice cream once more after it partly sets again, for a more smoother texture."
- "Once set, then Serve the mango ice cream scoops topped with honey, chocolate sauce or you can even serve it with slices of cake as a dessert."
