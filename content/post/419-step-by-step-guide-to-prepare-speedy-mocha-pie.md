Mocha Filling: I couldn&#39;t tell you when the craving for a mocha pie originated, only that it is a desire I have been trying to ignore for the better part of a year. My affections lie firmly in the fruit pie camp, which is why the urge for a rich pudding of dark chocolate and coffee, tucked into a flaky crust and topped with mounds of espresso whipped cream was a mystery to me. Featuring a thick brownie crust, a filling made of creamy mocha pudding, and--for the crowning touch--a coffee-and-Kahl√∫a whipped topping, it&#39;s hard to believe this pie could be light. Your favorite drink, now in pie form. Hmm, that&#39;s all I have to say about ingredients.
