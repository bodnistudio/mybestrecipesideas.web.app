		Honey Crisp: The pie pictured uses ALL honey crisp apples.
	
		I don&#39;t always do this but honey crisp apples are delicious and if you&#39;re going to go with a very simple, one varietal type of pie, I say you can&#39;t lose with honey crisp.
	
		You&#39;ll put the pie plate directly on that, which helps the bottom crust turn a bit more flaky, rather than totally soggy.
	
		Zest and juice lemon and add to apples.
	
		Add Flour and Sugar and Pumpkin pie spice.
