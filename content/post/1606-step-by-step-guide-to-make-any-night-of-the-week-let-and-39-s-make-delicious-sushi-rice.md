- "1/2 tbsp Salt natural salt"
- "5 tbsp Vinegar"
- "4 tbsp Sugar"
- "5 to 10 cm square piece Kombu for dashi stock"
recipeinstructions:
- "[I made 5 rice cooker cups worth this time] Pour in a little less water than usual to cook the rice. Add the kombu and leave the rice to soak for at least 30 minutes."
- "Add the salt to the rice cooker and mix lightly. Use the &#34;sushi rice&#34; setting (or if your rice cooker doesn&#39;t have one, just use the regular setting) to cook the rice."
- "Mix the vinegar and sugar together. ※Microwave just before adding it to the rice to about 40-50°C, and mix well to dissolve the sugar."
- "When the rice is cooked, take out the kombu and invert the rice cooker bowl to take out the rice into a plastic container or bowl. Swirl in the warm sushi vinegar from Step 3, and quickly mix it into the rice in a cutting motion."
- "Cover the container or bowl with a lid and leave for 7 minutes to steam and let the rice absorb the flavors. If the bowl doesn&#39;t have a lid, use a pot lid or a cutting board to cover."
- "Remove the lid, and mix the rice using a cut-and-fold motion while fanning it to cool it down. (This will make the rice glossy)."
- "If you are making chirashi sushi, mix the ingredients in while the rice is still warm. If you&#39;re making sushi rolls, let the rice cool down to about body temperature first."
- "I made Western style chirashi sushi this time:  https://cookpad.com/en/recipes/188384-western-style-chirashi-sushi-a-popular-school-lunch-item. The additional ingredients are easy so you can make this sushi anytime you like."
