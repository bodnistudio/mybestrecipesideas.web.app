recipeinstructions:
- "Chop the meat into inch big cubes. Heat pan, sear the meat, add the onion."
- "Either add into a slow cooker or cook over a long time on low temperature on stove top, add a little of the ale in pot on stove. This may foam up but will settle quickly. For cooking in slow cooker add a little of the ale into pan to get all the searing flavour of the bottom of pan then add this into the slow cooker with the meat. Either way add the rest of the ale and all the other ingredients except the salt and pastry. Only add the salt towards the very end for taste if needed."
- "When the meat is almost falling apart turn of the slow cooker or the pot on the stove. Pour all the sauce into a small sauce pan, boil until reduced by half. Mix cornflour with about 3-4 level teaspoons of cold milk or water as desired add to the sauce to make a thick gravy. Add to the meat, let it cool down, or pastry might get soggy."
- "You can make your own pastry or use shop bought pastry either is fine. Line the bottom of your pie dish with rolled out shortcut pastry, then egg wash the edges before you top with puff pastry or just shortcrust pastry"
- "Crimp the pastry over and egg wash the pastry. Bake pie in preheated oven at 180 for about 25 to 30 minutes or until crispy golden brown. Enjoy"
- "For the shortcrust pastry as it is easiest put the flour into a big bowl. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until you have a mixture that looks like breadcrumbs, there should be no lumps of butter left in the mix. Make sure it does not become to greasy."
- "Add water just a little at a time to start binding the dough together. Then wrap the dough in kitchen wrap / cling film and put it into the fridge for about 20 minutes. Then roll out onto a lightly floured board as needed."
