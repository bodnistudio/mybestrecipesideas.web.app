This dish makes it a lot easier. It is made pretty much exactly the same as pizza, but with ground beef as the crust. Sounds weird at first, but it is absolutely delicious and very filling. Crustless pizza with mushrooms, black olives, onions, and sliced tomatoes, baked with our original sauce and signature three cheeses, plus feta, topped with romesan seasoning and garlic sauce. Additional pizza bowls may be available.
