Driving all over New Jersey in search of the state&#39;s best bakeries seems like an impossible mission - for everyone but Pete Genovese. Sticky buns were made for slow-moving Sunday mornings. These are extra special thanks to coffee in the fillings and glaze. Sticky buns are baked in their sweet, gooey caramel sauce, while cinnamon rolls are baked in the pan, sans any sauce, then topped with a cream cheese glaze. The second difference is the addition of nuts, which I personally scrapped for today&#39;s recipe, and I&#39;ll explain why next.
