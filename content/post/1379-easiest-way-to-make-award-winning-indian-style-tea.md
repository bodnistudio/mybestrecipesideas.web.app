Indians like their Tea with milk - and that does not mean just adding a spot of milk to the tea after infusion. Indian tea or Chaai is made by cooking the tea leaves in a mixture of milk and water, till it acquires a rich hue, aroma and flavour. This recipe tells you how to make Indian tea, a perfect cup of homemade Chaai. Chai (Spiced Indian-style Tea) From Badmaash restaurant, in Los Angeles, this aromatic tea, called &#34;cutting chai&#34; in India, is served in small glasses because it&#39;s so strong (&#34;cutting&#34; is the transliteration of the Hindi word for &#34;half&#34;). It is the fourth largest in tea exports, behind Kenya, China, and Sri Lanka, respectively.
