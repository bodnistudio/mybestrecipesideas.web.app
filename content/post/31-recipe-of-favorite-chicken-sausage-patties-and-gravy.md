This is your basic sausage gravy. After trying several recipes from this site, our favorite gravy recipe is the &#34;Country Sausage Gravy&#34;. I did add garlic and onion powder, as well as a bit of dried herb seasoning. Pour in broth and bring to a boil, whisking the browned bits of food off the bottom of the skillet.

This healthy sausage gravy draws inspiration from southern-style country pepper gravy and turns boring ground chicken into a flavorful base for thick and creamy biscuit dressing. The chicken is crisp and juicy, the gravy creamy and spicy. Ah, this meal just makes me feel happy. We serve this dish with a big scoop of our Perfect Mashed Potatoes and whatever vegetable we happen to have on hand. Pour grease out of the skillet/pan you used for the sausage, adding back in only what you want to use to make the gravy.
