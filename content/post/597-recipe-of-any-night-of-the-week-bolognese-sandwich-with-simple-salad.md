Pour stock and milk into pot; add a pinch of salt. This is a great pasta sauce to make ahead, dishes with tomatoes and spices &#34;meld and marry.&#34; as they sit and have even better flavor (like a chili recipe). This Bolognese sauce is dedicated to the late great Marcella Hazan. She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food, and at a time when most Americans thought &#39;Bolognese&#39; was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger, Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be. Grind bologna with a grinder or food processor.
