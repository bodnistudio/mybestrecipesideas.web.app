It might not be the most beautiful creation, but it will be. Spinach, bacon, artichokes, AND cheese stuffed inside chicken? Hasselback your chicken by cutting shallow slits into your chicken breasts (don&#39;t cut all the way through!) and stuff each slit with bacon and a creamy spinach and artichoke filling. Stuff each chicken breast with the cream cheese mixture and close the chicken breast the best you can. I have found that it works just as well to spread the Once you try this Bacon and Cream Cheese Stuffed Chicken Breast, you won&#39;t want any other kind of chicken.
