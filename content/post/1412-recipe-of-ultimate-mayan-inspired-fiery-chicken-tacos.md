- "Next chop and prepare veggies for both salsa and guacamole in separate dishes to make it easy to mix later. NOTE: wait to cut and spoon out avocado until you are ready to mix guacamole ingredients together."
- "For salsa: Freeze tomatoes for a couple minutes to firm them up to avoid squashing them. Add tomatoes, onions, peppers, garlic, cilantro, corn and cucumber to small mixing bowl and gently combine. Then add salt and lime juice and gently mix in."
- "For guacamole: Cut open and discard pit of avocado. Spoon out interior and mash with fork till mostly smooth. (I prefer a few chunks of avocado.) Then mix in cilantro, onion, garlic, tomato, and pepper together in bowl. Add salt, lime juice and black pepper and mix. Put a lid or cellophane on top of bowl and then refrigerate until ready to serve."
- "Once chicken is complete, remove from grill and let rest for 5 minutes, then slice into strips."
- "Serve together or separately with chips! I like serving then as tacos with a little cheese and sour cream, but that is entirely up to you. Enjoy!"
- "P.S. for a little kick add some habanero pepper sauce! Remember a little habanero goes a long way!"
