- "2 tbsp Margarine or sesame oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the meat into easy-to-eat sizes and add them to a plastic bag along with ingredients 1-4. Leave to marinate for half a day. (Marinating in the oil will help to make a tender steak.)"
- "Once the oil has been completely absorbed, transfer the meat to another plastic bag filled with flour and shake. (Coating the meat with flour will help stop the juices from leaking out.)"
- "Cook in the margarine. No juices should leak out and even if you cook the meat through to the middle it won&#39;t go hard.)"
