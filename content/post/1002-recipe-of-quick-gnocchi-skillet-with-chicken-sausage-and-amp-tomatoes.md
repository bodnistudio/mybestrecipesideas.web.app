recipeingredient:
- "1 lb gnocchi"
- "9 oz about 3 links cooked chicken sausage sliced into 14inchthick coins"
- "1 pints cherry or grape tomatoes sliced in half lengthwise"
- "1 to 2 ounces fresh basil julienned 12 to 1 cup loosely packed"
- "1 Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a large pot of salted water to boiling; cook the gnocchi for 2 minutes or according to package directions. Drain and toss with a drizzle of olive oil."
- "Heat a 10-inch or larger cast iron skillet over medium heat with a light drizzle of olive oil. Add the sausage and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it begins to brown. Push the sausage into a pile at the edge of the skillet and turn the heat up to high."
- "When the skillet is quite hot, add the tomatoes, skin down, crowding them in if necessary. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until they are blistered, then stir in with the sausage. Cook for 2 more minutes, until both tomatoes and sausage are slightly browned. Stir in gnocchi and cook just until all is combined, but the tomatoes have not broken down into sauce."
- "Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the basil. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately."
- "Recipe Notes •Any cooked chicken sausage is good in this dish, although I do prefer one with a little extra flavor added, like red peppers or garlic.  •I specify a cast iron skillet because I think it gives the best color and sear to the tomatoes and sausage. However, any deep skillet or sauté pan should work as well, provided it doesn&#39;t have a nonstick coating, which will interfere with browning."
