Hello everybody, it's me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, bok choy salad. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Bok Choy Salad is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It's appreciated by millions daily. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. Bok Choy Salad is something which I have loved my whole life. They're fine and they look fantastic.

I couldn&#39;t find baby bok choy so I had to use regular bok choy, and used tarragon vinegar rather than plain white vinegar, and this was so delicious!
