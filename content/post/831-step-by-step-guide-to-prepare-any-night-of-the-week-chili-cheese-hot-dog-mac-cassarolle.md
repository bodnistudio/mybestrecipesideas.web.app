Unfortunately, using boxed mac and cheese can be rather disappointing; so I decided it was time to make a casserole that consisted of sliced hot dogs and homemade mac and cheese. You can use whatever type of hot dogs you like; I always prefer the all-beef hot dogs. Pour the chili over the hot dogs, sprinkle with the chopped onion, then spread the mustard over the chili and the onion. Beef franks, chili and beans, tortillas and Cheddar cheese form the layers of this deceptively simple and unnusual casserole. Where has this recipe been all my life???
