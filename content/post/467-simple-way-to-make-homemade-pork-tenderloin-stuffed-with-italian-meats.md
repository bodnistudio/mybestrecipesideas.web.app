To flatten the tenderloin, place a layer of plastic wrap over the scored meat and use the flat side of a meat mallet to gently pound the pork until it is an even quarter-inch in thickness all around. Choose whatever flavor sausage you like. I first looked for mild Italian and couldn&#39;t find any so I chose Bratwurst instead. You can either reserve some of the Lemon-Thyme Dijon sauce or make this new Dijon, White Wine and Tarragon mustard sauce to serve with the pork tenderloin after it comes off the grill.
