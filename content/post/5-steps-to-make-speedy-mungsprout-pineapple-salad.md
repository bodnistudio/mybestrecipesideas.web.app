It tastes like good old Japan to me!! A pool of kokum saar that surrounds yellowfin tuna tartare, charred pineapple and mung sprout salad is good enough to drink by the mugful, or sneak into a cocktail. In a very hot wok, coat well with oil and add scallions, ginger and garlic. Quickly add the bean sprouts and stir-fry, flipping the sprouts around quickly.
