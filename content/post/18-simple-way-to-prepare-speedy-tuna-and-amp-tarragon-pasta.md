The term tuna encompasses several species of fish, including skipjack, albacore, yellowfin, and bigeye. Skipjack is the most commonly consumed species. Meaty tuna steaks and fillets cook quickly on the grill or stovetop, and the subtle flavor can be enhanced by a variety of sauces and seasonings. High-quality ahi tuna is also delicious eaten raw in thin slices or as part of sushi rollsâ€”and even makes an outstanding burger. Tuna packed in water has a milder flavor and fewer calories than oil-packed, so if you need a can for your everyday tuna salad on rye, water-packed works fine.
