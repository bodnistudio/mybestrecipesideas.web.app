In the US, I notice that it is often called a shepherd&#39;s pie when it really is just a cottage pie. Since the type of meat used is the only real difference in this dish, I find most have a version using beef that they call shepherd&#39;s pie even if it technically. wow i&#39;m really glad you posted this recipe bc i&#39;ve been looking for a simple shepards pie recipe for weeks now but I couldn&#39;t find one I liked.

BTW I went to bedbath&amp;beyond and they didn&#39;t have the donut pan!! Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. Traditionally, shepherd&#39;s pie is made with lamb (hence the name). However, as the dish gained wider popularity outside of its native English homeland (where using beef would make this a cottage pie), beef became a common substitute, especially in America where it&#39;s more widely available than ground lamb.
