Here&#39;s what you need: all the stuff you have in your pantry! Start by sifting together the flour, baking powder, and salt.

A glaze made with unsalted butter, orange liqueur, and sugar is brushed on top of the cake for bright, zesty contrast. Crumbly cake, sweet, rich goodness, and a reason to sit down and gab over a cup of coffee: such is the magic that is coffee cake.
