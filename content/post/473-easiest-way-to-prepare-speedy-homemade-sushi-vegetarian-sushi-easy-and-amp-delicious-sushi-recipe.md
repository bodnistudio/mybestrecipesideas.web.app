- "8 ml rice vinegar"
- "3 tablespoons sugar"

- "Put the rice in a large bowl, wash with cold water. Wash and drain the water until the water is clear. Pour the rice into a soup strainer and set aside for 30 minutes to allow it to drip well."
- "Put the rice in a pan and add the water. Let the rice soak in cold water for at least 30 minutes. Light it underneath and cook in boiled water for 15 minutes."
