The broth is simple but packed with savory umami flavor. Try our take on a classic miso soup recipe. This vegan recipe features the lovely &amp; fresh kale but feel free to use any leafy greens of your choice. In creating this vegan tofu noodle soup, I used a mixture of olive oil with just a little bit of coconut oil to improve the mouthfeel.
