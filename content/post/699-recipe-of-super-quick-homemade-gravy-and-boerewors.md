The most iconic way to cook boerewors is on the grill, but sausages can&#39;t simply be blasted with heat like a steak or a burger patty. Boerewors is a sausage, popular in South African cuisine. The name comes from the Afrikaans words boer (&#34;farmer&#34;) and wors (&#34;sausage&#34;), and is pronounced /ˈbuːrəvors/, with a trilled IPA /r/. Boerewors is based on an older traditional Dutch sausage called the verse worst. I developed this recipe to recapture the flavours of the rustic South African sausage - boerewors means farmer&#39;s sausage.
