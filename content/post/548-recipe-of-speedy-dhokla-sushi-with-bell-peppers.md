Green bell peppers are the most bitter since they&#39;ve been on the vine the shortest amount of time. Yellow peppers and orange are sweeter with red bell peppers being the sweetest of them all. Can you tell if a pepper is male or female? If bell peppers and onions don&#39;t do it for you, the sky&#39;s the limit when it comes to creating an omelet that has your name written all over it.
