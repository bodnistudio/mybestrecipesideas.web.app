- "If using canned version, start with sauteeing garlic and onions in oil in a pan. Add the canned corned beef, including the solid fat bits you see in it (that makes it tasty!). My favorite is the Delimondo brand atm. More expensive than the other local kinds but you can be sure it&#39;s 100% beef. Delicious too."

(unpeeled but brushed potatoes, it&#39;s my thing, LOL, not very cheffy but I want the nutrients in it)."
