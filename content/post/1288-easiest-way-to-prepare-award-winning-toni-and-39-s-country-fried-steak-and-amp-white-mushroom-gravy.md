Most of our Main Meals are served with thick cut fries and a choice of either green garden salad or an Tender fillet steak made even better with a topping of our special herbaceous buttery Béarnaise sauce. Country-fried steak is most often served with a brown gravy. However, this is not always the case, as you can see in various recipes. Smothered steak, another version, is fried then simmered in gravy, which makes a tougher cut of meat even more tender.
