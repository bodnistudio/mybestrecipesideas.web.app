<h3>Steps to make Lemon pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			For the pie crust: mix all ingredients until the dough is firm. Spread with a rolling pin the size of your baking sheet (I like to use two plastic bags around the dough so the it won&#39;t stick in the surface). Use a fork to make small holes or baked beans in the dough. Cook in pre heated oven (180Â°C) until its golden brown.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			For the vanilla cream: dilute the corn starch with a little bit of milk. Put the milk, the corn starch milk and the condensed milk in a pan and mix (don&#39;t stop mixing) in low heat until it&#39;s creamy and firm. Turn the heat off and mix in vanilla and heavy cream. Wait to cool down a bit and put in the pie crust..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			For the lemon cream: mix condensed milk and lime juice. Spread over the pie..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			For the meringue: beat the egg whites with sugar until it&#39;s fluffy. Spread over the pie and make small peaks with a fork. I like to use lime zests to decorate a bit. Bake in low heat until the peaks get a little brown (watch constantly because it can burn!). Let it cool and put in the fridge at least 2h before eating..
