<h3>Steps to make Almond Crumble Mince Pies:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Put the flour, butter and cinnamon in a food processor and gradually pulse until you have a mixture the texture of fine breadcrumbs. You can also do this by hand using your finger tips to rub the butter into the flour..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the sugar and egg yolk, and about 2 tbsp water. Pulse until the dough starts to form..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			When the pastry looks like this, tip it out onto a floured surface and use your hands to gently bring together into a ball. Flatten, wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 20 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			For the streusel topping, place the flour, butter, sugar and cinnamon in a food processor and pulse to fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the flaked almonds..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pre-heat the oven to 180Â°C/Gas 4. Roll out the chilled pastry and cut out circles of dough big enough to line bun tins, there was enough pastry to make 24, but I had one deep set of tins and one shallow set..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Half fill the shells with mincemeat, then sprinkle the streusel mixture over to cover. Sprinkle a few slivered almonds on the top of each and then bake in the oven for about 20 to 25 minutes until golden..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Allow to sit in the tins for about 5 to 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire tray. Serve warm, dusted with icing sugar and topped with a spoonful of brandy cream..
			
			
		</li>
	
</ol>

		These mince pies benefit from a boozy mincemeat filling - a little whisky is added to regular mincemeat for good measure.
	
		The vanilla almond topping is a tasty change from pastry, and might we say easier, too!
