recipeingredient:
- "1000 grams Uncooked white rice"
- "3 pieces Konbu for dashi 3 cm square pieces"
- "10 slice Aburaage"
- "4 tbsp  Vinegar"
- "1 and 13 tablespoons  Light brown sugar or white sugar"
- "1 tsp  Salt"
- "3 tbsp  Mirin"
- "100 ml  Light brown sugar or white sugar"
- "2 tbsp  Soy sauce"
- "1/2 tsp  Salt"
- "200 ml  Water"
- "7 tbsp Salmon flakes storebought"
- "2 small knobs Ginger"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the aburaage 5 pieces at a time on a plate, and microwave (at 500 W) for 1 minute 20 seconds. The aburaage layers will separate and become less likely to rip."
- "Cut 3 open sides of each aburaage to make them into single sheets. This is easy if you use a pair of round-tipped scissors."
- "Blanch the opened up aburaage in boiling water to remove the oil on the surface. Put the ★ ingredients in a pan and bring to a boil, then add the aburaage. Use a pair of cooking chopsticks flipped around (so you are using the blunt ends)."
- "Cover with a lid and bring to a boil. Simmer over low heat for 5 minutes, and leave to cool in the pan. The aburaage tastes the best if you cook them the night before and leave them overnight to soak up the flavors."
- "Rinse the rice, drain into a sieve and leave for 30 minutes. Add the konbu seaweed, and cook in a rice cooker using just a little less water than usual."
- "Make the sushi vinegar by combining the ● ingredients. Empty the cooked rice into a bowl, and fold in the sushi vinegar."
- "Mix the salmon flakes and finely julienned ginger into the rice. Place an opened up aburaage sheet on a sheet of plastic wrap. Leave a gap on the far side and spread the sheet with the sushi rice. Roll it up using the plastic wrap."
- "Leave the roll for a while with the seam side down to let it settle, then cut into 6 pieces."
