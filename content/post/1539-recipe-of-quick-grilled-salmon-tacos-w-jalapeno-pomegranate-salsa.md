recipeinstructions:

- "Rinse the salmon filets under cold water and gently pat them dry with paper towels. Place the fish in a large Ziploc bag."
- "In a small bowl, combine the juice of 1 lime, the chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and sliced garlic. Pour the mixture into the bag with the salmon. Seal the bag, removing as much air as possible, and gently squish the fish around to coat with marinade. Marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature, turning the bag over once halfway through."

- "Pre-heat a lightly oiled grill (pan) over medium-high heat. When hot, add the salmon and cook for about 4 minutes per side until cooked through and lightly charred on the outside. Transfer salmon to a cutting board and flake with a fork. (I like to leave some larger chunks.)"
- "Warm the tortillas. You can do this in your microwave, or throw each tortilla directly on your burner for a few seconds per side."
