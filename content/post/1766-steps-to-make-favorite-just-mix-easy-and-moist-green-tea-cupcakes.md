recipeinstructions:
- "Break the ★chocolate into small pieces. Add butter, and melt in a double boiler about 50°C. (Do not let the water get too hot! It should be hot, but cool enough to touch without burning)"
- "While the chocolate is melting, combine the ◎ eggs and sugar in a mixing bowl. (Whisk together lightly, but there is no need to beat them.)"
- "In a separate bowl, mix the ● dry ingredients together. (Many recipes ask you to sift the dry ingredients twice, but here you can just mix it and set it aside)."
- "When the chocolate and butter from Step 2 have melted, remove from the double boiler and mix together. Preheat the oven to 150°C."
- "While the chocolate mixture from Step 5 is still warm, add it all at once to the egg mixture from Step 3. Stir to mix these together."
- "You just want to whisk until the mixture is uniform!"
- "Sift the dry ingredients from Step 4 into the mixture from Step 7."
- "Without kneading, fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients using a rubber spatula. You should mix it very lightly."
- "Spoon the batter into the muffin cups until they are a little more than half full. (about 65g of batter per cup)"
- "Break the chocolate for garnish into small pieces, and sprinkle into each cup. I used what was leftover (you could omit this, but I wanted to use the leftover chocolate)"
- "Bake in an oven preheated to 150°C for 20 ~ 25 minutes (the cupcakes are done when a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean)."
- "150°C may seem too low, but if the temperature is higher, the cupcakes will brown and the beautiful matcha colour will be lost. I recommend baking at low temperature!"
