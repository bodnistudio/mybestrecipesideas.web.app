<h3>Steps to make CC&#39;S fall spiced pancakes:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			In a bowl mix milk and lemon juice set aside.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Mix all dry ingredients in a bowl.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Melt butter than add to milk and lemon juice. Add egg and mix together..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add wet and dry ingredients together until smooth and then shake in pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon, mix some more. (I kept the milk near by because my batter was to thick at first).
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Heat pan on medium heat not to high so your pancakes don&#39;t burn. Use oil or pam spray in pan as well to prevent sticking..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add batter to heated pan do not flip until you see bubbles the more bubbles the better.  Just lift to make sure its not burning..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cook until done I usually poke the middle to make sure it&#39;s cooked all the way...
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Put on your favorite plate top with a pat of butter and more pumpkin pie spice.. drizzle with agave syrup &amp; enjoy! !.

		Topped with a sticky, cinnamon-scented apple compote, we don&#39;t even need maple syrup.

		These pumpkin spice pancakes are everything you look for in a pancake — light and fluffy with crisp edges, plenty of flavor and easy to make.
	
		They aren&#39;t your typical pancake and I attribute it to the creamy addition of the pumpkin pie spice coffee creamer made by International Delight®.
