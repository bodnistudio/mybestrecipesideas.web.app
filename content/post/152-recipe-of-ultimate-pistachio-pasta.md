Two of the most important ingredients in the Sicilian kitchen are ricotta and pistachios. Both are used in desserts and pasta recipes. This Sicilian ricotta and pistachio pasta is a delicious example of how beautifully these two typical foods can be used together to make a divine creamy plate of pasta. The mellow sweetness of this thick and flavorful pistachio paste will stand on its own when spread over toast or stuffed between layers of cake, but it can also work to flavor other desserts as well, whether into a pistachio chantilly, twirled up with a yeasty dough for breakfast buns, or used as a stand-in for almond paste (think: pistachio stollen!).
