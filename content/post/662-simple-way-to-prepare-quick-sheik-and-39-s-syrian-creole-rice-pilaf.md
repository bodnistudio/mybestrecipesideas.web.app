Lebanese vermicelli rice scented with cinnamon is the basis for so many plates that keeping our version of the rice from its fully realized life out here with you is…criminal. Mom has always studded the already delicious, simple Lebanese cinnamon rice with the incredibly savory addition mushrooms, garlic, scallions, and pine nuts. In Malaysia, Pilaf, Pulao and Biryani are the same thing for convenience sake but in India, Pilaf (which is also called Pulao) is distinct from Biryani. With Pilaf, you cook the rice with the meat or veggies together in one pot, sort of like a casserole. See recipes for Honey pecan chicken breast w/rice pilaf (RSC recipe) too.
