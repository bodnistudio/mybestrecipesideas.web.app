Long pasta cuts like spaghetti and fettucini are doable, but you may have to stir a couple more times in between. Turn your slow cooker to high when you add your pasta. Baked ziti usually requires multiple steps: cooking the pasta, making the sauce, layering in the cheese, and, finally, baking everything in the oven. Our goal was to simplify the process by making this classic dish in a slow cooker. Pour remaining meat sauce over the top and place the lid on the slow cooker.
