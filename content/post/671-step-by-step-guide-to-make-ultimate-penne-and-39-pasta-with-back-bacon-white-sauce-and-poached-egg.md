I make a version of this all the time … but I omit the cream cheese, add a half stick of butter, instead. The creamy sauce, the bacon, the bright green peas and a good pasta make this a great winter meal! This classic carbonara sauce can be served with your favorite pasta variety and makes an indulgent and quick dinner! I can&#39;t eat, think about, dream about, or even remotely consider Pasta Carbonara without thinking of Heartburn, the Meryl Streep/Jack Nicholson movie from the eighties that I both love and hate. Love, because it&#39;s incredibly written by Norah Ephron and incredibly acted by Meryl and Jack.
