- " Milk"

recipeinstructions:
- "Chop the carrot, and slice the onion, garlic, and celery. I am a big fan of celery leaves because they are intensely flavored... so I add some as a bonus."
- "Put the olive oil and sliced garlic to a pot, and cook over medium-low heat. When the garlic is lightly browned, add the shrimp shells and sauté for a while."
- "When the shrimp shells turned pink, add all the carrot, onion and celery, and cook them over medium heat."
- "When the vegetables are cooked, add the white whine and cook for a minute. Then add the puréed tomatoes (crush them as needed) and the bay leaf. Stir and cook over medium-low heat. When liquid is reduced by about half, turn off the fire and let it cool down for a while."
- "After it&#39;s cooled, take out the bay leaf and pour everything else into a blender. Blend the solids until they turn into a purée."
- "Strain the purée and put it back in the pot. Add the milk and cook slowly over low heat. Finish with salt and pepper to taste."
- "Serve garnished with parsley. For a change, you could substitute the parsley for cilantro."
