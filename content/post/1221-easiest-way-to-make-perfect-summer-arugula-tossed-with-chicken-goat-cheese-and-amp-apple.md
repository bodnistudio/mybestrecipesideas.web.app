recipeinstructions:
- "Arugula is pretty peppery and the trick is to  pile a serving onto a plate and use your kitchen scissors (clean) to rough-cut the pile. It releases the flavor and brings out the crispness..."
- "Add chicken, cut to bite-sized chunks."
- "Slice 1/4 to 1/2 a medium apple. If you&#39;re concerned about carbs counts, 1/4 medium apple is one serving @ about 15 grams of carbs."

- "Top with Muruku crunchies. Especially good for diabetics or those watching carbs, the Indian bean curd snack can be found at most food co-ops and is worth the monthly trek to keep a stash in your pantry."
