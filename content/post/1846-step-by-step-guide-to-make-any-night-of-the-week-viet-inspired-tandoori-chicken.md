recipeingredient:
- " For the chicken"
- "3.5-4 pounds bonein skinon chicken pieces thighs drums wings and halved breast pieces"
- " For the marinade"
- "1 Tablespoon curry powder"
- "3 cloves garlic chopped"
- "1 Tablespoon minced ginger"
- "1/2 cup yogurt"
- "1 Tablespoon brown sugar"
- "2  14 Tablespoons fish sauce"
- "1 Tablespoon tomato paste"
- "1/4 cup chopped cilantro for the marinade  a little more for garnish you can use the stems"
- " zest of half a lime"
- "1 jalapeo chopped"
- "1 Tablespoon lime juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place all marinade ingredients in a large mixing bowl and stir or whisk to combine thoroughly."
- "Place the chicken in the marinade and mix gently but thoroughly to evenly season each piece. Cover the bowl &amp; place it in the fridge to marinate for 6 to 24 hours, redistributing the chicken 2x during the marinating period to ensure even seasoning. Or you can put it all in a gallon capacity Ziploc bag, lay all the meat in a single layer, suction all the air out of it, and lay it on its side in the fridge. You can flip halfway through to ensure even seasoning."
- "An hour before cooking, take the chicken out of the fridge and lay it in a single layer on either a sturdy sheet pan (not a cookie sheet) with a grill rack over it (my preferred method), or on a broiler pan with slats, skin side up, and let it come up to room temp. I mention this often, but bringing your protein up to room temp results in a better outer sear, which results in more internal juiciness."
- "20 minutes before cooking, preheat your oven to 450F. Once the oven&#39;s preheated, put the chicken on the center rack of the oven and roast for 45 to 55 minutes, depending on the size of your chicken pieces."
- "That&#39;s it! Enjoy. :)"
