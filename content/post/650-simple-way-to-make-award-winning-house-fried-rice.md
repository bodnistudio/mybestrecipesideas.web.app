House special fried rice is a popular rice dish consisting of generous portions of shrimps, beef, and chicken along with the customary eggs and vegetables; learn the simple technique which turns this hearty one pot meal from good to ultra special! Remove from skillet and set aside. The key to Korean fried rice is to use one-day-old, leftover rice; freshly cooked rice causes the fried rice to be sticky and soggy in texture. I usually present this dish on a square plate.

Garnish with green onions, cherry tomatoes, sesame seeds, and cilantro to bring color and provide an extra visual of texture and crunch. Avoid using short-grain or sushi rice for this dish, which will result in a starch, clumpy dish. A large wok placed over high heat, or a countertop griddle, are also essential in recreating Japanese-style fried rice at home. You can use Asian short or long grain rice, whichever you prefer. I like to use Basmati or Japanese short grain rice because that&#39;s what I have in my pantry most of the time.
