Fill pita bread or line plates with lettuce and place scoops of this crunchy apple, celery, walnut and turkey salad on top. The Mayo to Mustard Ratio: I&#39;m a mayo enthusiast, but when it comes to chicken or turkey salad, I like to go light. Too much mayo can yield a very thick and heavy salad, while just the right balance of mayo and Dijon mustard produces a medley of flavors that don&#39;t overpower the refreshing crispness of the veggies and herbs. Skip the bread and serve this turkey salad on a lettuce-lined plate with cut-up fresh vegetables or fruits. For less fat per serving, use fat-free or reduced-fat mayonnaise.
