<h3>Instructions to make Sheree&#39;s Beef Pot Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			I make my own crusts... Because sugary crust are for desserts but they are not good for meat pies.  The crust can be made and either the dough frozen.... OR.... The pie crust can be rolled out and put in a disposable aluminum pie pan...  I place the pie pans on a cookie sheet until frozen.  Place was paper between them and slide into a 2 gallon freezer bag..  That way they are ready whenever you need them..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			THE RECIPE FOR PIE CRUST CAN BE FOUND ON MY PROFILE. I&#39;m not going to repost instructions...
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Begin brown your ground beef. Add onion, pepper, garlic, salt...  When the ground beef is almost done add diced potatoes (you just want them to start getting soft..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Preheat oven at 350°..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Drain hamburger and potato mix to get rid of the extra oil..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add veggies ( you can add other veggies.. We just like these).
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add soup mix....        IF YOU DONT HAVE  DRY SOUP MIX...there is a recipe for PAN GRAVY on my profile.  You will not need the jar of gravy if you make this...
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the can of tomatoes....  Add thyme... Add the jar of beef gravy... UNLESS YOU ARE MAKING GRAVY...mix well...
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pour 1/2 mixture in each pie crust..(enough to make 2 pies.  There should be approx 1&#34; from the top of crust..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place top crust on pie and go around the edges and press down with the tongs of a fork..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			I use an old paint brush... But paint the top of the pies with milk.... This will help it turn gold... You can also use a egg/ milk wash..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Put pies on a cookie sheet in case they bubble over. Cut vents to allow steam to escape on top of each pie. 4 should be plenty.... I sometime cut a smiley face on them..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Let cook at 350° for 1 hr.  It should be bubbly and golden...
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			****because the dry soup have sodium....  If you are salt sensitive do not add extra salt... Hugs!!!.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Take out of oven and allow to sit 30 minutes before cutting.
			
			
		</li>
