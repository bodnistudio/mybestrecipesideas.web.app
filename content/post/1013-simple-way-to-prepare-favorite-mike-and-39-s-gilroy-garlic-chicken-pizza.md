recipeinstructions:
- "Only use jars of Bertolli Garlic Alfredo Or Ragu Garlic Alfredo Sauce since many others will lend a metallic taste to your white sauce. For this same reason, mix your white sauce in a glass or plastic bowl. Nothing metal."
- "Drain artichokes, spinach [if opted] and black olives very well and rough chop. Squeeze the artichokes and spinach in cheesecloth or paper towels until they run dry. You don&#39;t want a soggy pizza."
- "● Simmer your sun dried tomatoes in 2 cups water or 2 cups red wine for 4 - 5 minutes until soft - then drain well. Rough chop. Or, you can simply soak them in water or red wine for 30 to 60 minutes on the counter.                                                                                                                                                   ● Tip: Save those juices for soups and stews. It&#39;s chalked with nutrition. But, use it within days or it will go bad on you."
- "Chop up chicken [optional for vegetarians] and mushrooms and place your 2 lb bag of Mozterella on the counter. You&#39;ll want your cheese at room temp before constructing your pizzas."
- "● Mix everything together except for olive oil, Motzerella, fresh spinach-optional, mushrooms, black olives and 3/4 of your artichokes and chicken [you&#39;re reserving these ingredients for the tops of your pizzas] in a large bowl. Allow flavors to marry in the fridge for one hour +. This step is important. Stir mixture occasionally.                                                                                                                                                                                                  ● We&#39;ll occasionally employ spinach to this pizza - fresh or frozen. See photo below. It shows frozen spinach. If employing frozen - feather it and add directly to your Alfredo mixture. Fresh spinach will go on the top of your pizza."
- "When ready, heat oven to 425°. It&#39;s best if you have a pizza stone but, a non-stick cookie sheet will work as well."
- "Brush olive oil around crust edges of your pizzas and sprinkle garlic and onion powder atop the oil if you&#39;d like for extra bite."
- "Generously spread your mixture on your pizza crusts. Not too heavy though."
- "● Cover pizzas as you desire with reserved artichokes, olives, fresh spinach, mushrooms, chicken and then, Motzerella Cheese.                                                                    ● If making more than one type of pizza, definitely reserve a few pieces of chicken and place on top of Mozterella so your guests can easily distinguish one type of pizza from another."
- "For garnishment toppers, you could add thin slices of purple onions, sprinkle additional red pepper flakes and dried or fresh parsley atop your pizzas."
- "Place pizzas on pizza stones or lowest rack in oven on tinfoil."
- "Bake at 450° until cheeses are bubbling and crust is crispy. About 25 minutes. Your crusts and cheese are your two best indicators here - so watch those closely."
- "Enjoy your pizzas!"
