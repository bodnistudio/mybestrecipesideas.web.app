Something about this Coffee Roulade with Cannoli Cream called my name when I spotted it recently in a food magazine. And let&#39;s be honest… what&#39;s not to love about a coffee sponge filled with a decadent vanilla flavoured mascarpone and ricotta cream? It&#39;s a match made in heaven - kind of like a mochaccino coffee (my favourite) in cake. A rich roulade that combines meringue, chocolate and coffee is a guaranteed crowdpleaser at any dinner party. Positioning the roulade with the long edge in front of you, spread the coffee cream over the surface of the roulade, to within one centimetre of the edge, and scatter with the raspberries and half.
