The moisture continuously &#34;bastes&#34; the chicken as it cooks slowly over low heat, thereby ensuring that the meat won&#39;t dry out. Pour out half the beer, reserving for another use.

Novelty aside, beer can chicken is the best, easiest way to cook a whole chicken on the grill without any special equipment. The beer from the can steams the chicken, resulting in a perfectly-cooked whole chicken — burnished to mahogany perfection — no flipping, rotisserie, or special pan required. Sub any canned soft drink or even chicken broth for the beer. I omitted the chili powder and added some cayenne pepper and ground sage. We didn&#39;t have a beer can chicken stand so I stood the chicken and can in an aluminum pie pan.
