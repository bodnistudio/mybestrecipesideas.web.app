- "Dot the halved tomatoes around the tart and then drizzle or spray olive oil over the surface."
- "Do an egg or milk wash over the border and then bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown on the edges and underneath. Sprinkle the feta over after 15 minutes. You may need to put foil over the edges if they are browning too quickly."
