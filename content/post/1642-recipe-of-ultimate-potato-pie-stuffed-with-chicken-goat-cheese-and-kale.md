		Working one at a time, carefully roll up thighs from short ends so they almost completely cover kale.
	
		For the potato cakes: Peel and coarsely grate the potatoes, season with salt and pepper and mix with the chives.
	
		This keto pie falls in the latter category.
	
		Add the chopped spinach to the pre-baked pie shell.
	
		Mix the grated cheese into the egg batter and pour over spinach.
