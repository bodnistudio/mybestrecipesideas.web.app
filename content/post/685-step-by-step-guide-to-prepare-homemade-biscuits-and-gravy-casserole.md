recipeingredient:
- "1 can large flaky biscuits such as Grands"
- "1/2 lb ground breakfast sausage"
- "3 tbsp allpurpose flour"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/2 tsp black pepper"
- "2 1/2 cup milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 400°F (F). Prepare a small casserole dish (approximately 7x10) with cooking spray. Set aside."
- "Open biscuits, and cut biscuits into quarters. Layer half of the quarters in prepared pan. Bake for 10 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, prepare gravy. In a heavy skillet, brown the ground breakfast sausage over medium high heat until fully cooked. Sprinkle the cooked sausage with 3 Tablespoons of flour. Use a wooden spoon to stir flour into sausage until completely absorbed. Lower heat to medium, and cook flour/sausage mixture for 3-5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add milk, and stir to combine. Add salt and black pepper. Stir frequently until mixture comes to a slight boil. Taste, and adjust seasonings as desired. (I usually add more black pepper) If the gravy is too thick, add a bit more milk. You want the gravy to be thickened but not too thick, not &#34;globby,&#34; it should still be slightly runny."
- "Pour gravy over the cooked biscuits. Layer the remaining uncooked, quartered biscuits over the gravy. Place casserole dish on a baking sheet, and bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. If they start to over-brown, you can cover with foil for the last 10 minutes or so. Serve immediately."
