recipeingredient:
- "1.5 pounds 8020 ground beef"
- "2 medium onions minced"
- "6 large cloves garlic minced"
- "2 Tablespoons oil vegetable or olive work fine"
- "1 Tablespoon dried basil"
- "2 teaspoons dried oregano"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "1 Tablespoon tightly packed brown sugar"
- "1/4 cup ketcup"
- "2 (28 oz.) cans tomatoes"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
- "1.5-2 teaspoons kosher salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large pot (4 quarts minimum), bring 1 Tablespoon oil to medium high heat and brown the ground beef, breaking it into small chunks as it cooks, and seasoning it with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Using a large cooking spoon, move the cooked meat to a bowl or plate and set aside. Remove some or all of the grease from the beef to your liking. (I like to leave about half for flavor.)"
- "Add 1 Tablespoon oil into the pot, reduce the heat to medium, and sweat the onions and garlic, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent. This should take 4 to 5 minutes."
- "Add in the dried herbs, stir them in, and give them a minute to bloom in the oil."
- "Add in the rest of the sauce ingredients, including the ground beef, give it 3 or 4 gentle stirs to mix everything together, and simmer with the lid askew (about 1/4-inch opening on one side) for a total of 45 minutes on medium low heat, stirring every 10 minutes or so to redistribute the ingredients and to make sure the sauce isn&#39;t burning on the bottom. If you can scrape stuff off the bottom during a long simmer, your heat&#39;s too high, and you should adjust down accordingly."
- "During the long simmer&#39;s a good time to boil and drain your pasta."
- "Before the last 10 minutes of simmer is a good time to adjust your seasonings as well."
- "Enjoy! :)"

Also add salt and pepper to the meat (to taste. I&#39;ve been stuffing pasta shells with different fillings for years, but my family enjoys this version with taco-seasoned meat the most. The frozen shells are so convenient, because you can take out only the number you need for a single-serving lunch or family dinner. Top with some grated parmesan and serve alongside garlic bread and a salad for the best spaghetti dinner. Now my kids are used to seeing &#34;green stuff&#34; in their pizza sauce, so I stir in the chopped spinach at the end.
