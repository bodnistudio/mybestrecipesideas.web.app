		This is my go-to pie recipe for carry-in events and holidays because you can quickly make it using a store bought graham cracker crust and a few simple ingredients.
	
		The amount of peanut butter in this filling is about double what many recipes call for.
	
		I upped it because I wanted the peanut butter to be more than a suggestion.
	
		Not only does the additional peanut butter add flavor, it also makes for a much richer filling — but one that still melts in your mouth.
	
		The pie includes chocolate pastry cream, peanut butter filling and slices of banana in a crust made of graham cracker crumbs, dry roasted peanuts and pretzels.
