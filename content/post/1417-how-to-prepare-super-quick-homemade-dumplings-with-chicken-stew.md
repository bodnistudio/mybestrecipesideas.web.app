recipeinstructions:
- "Use a large bowl put the 1kg flour (cake wheat flour) and add 1 packet of yeast add a pinch of salt and mix all dry ingredients together. You can add a pinch of mixed herbs to the dry mix if you like to be spontaneous but this is optional."
- "After mixing all your dry ingredients add 2 cups of warm water mix the dough using your hands but before you touch it add cooking oil to your hands to avoid the dough from sticking. The dough must not be too wet. Once perfectly mixed use a plastic packet put the bowl with the mix inside tie and place in the sun for about 40 minutes to an hour to let the dough rise."
- "Cook your chicken stew once your chicken is cooked ensure you have alot of gravy. I advise you take the meat out to make space for the dumplings. Take your dough mix (put oil your hands again) make dough balls and put in the the gravy while it&#39;s simmers on low heat and cover for 5 min then turn and let it cook for about 10 min. Put a knife through the dumpling to check if it&#39;s cooked, if the knife comes out dry with no wet dough it&#39;s ready to serve."
