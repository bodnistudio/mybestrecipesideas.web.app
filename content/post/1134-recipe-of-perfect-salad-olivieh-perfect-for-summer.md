Salad e Olivieh originates from Russia, where they call it &#34;Salad Olivier.&#34; It&#39;s made from diced (or mashed) potatoes, veggies, chicken, and bound by mayo. While there are several components, it&#39;s well worth the effort because it&#39;s so much more than a side dish; it&#39;s an entire meal. One of the most popular salads in Iran, Salad Olivieh is believed to have taken its influence from Russia and the salade russe, made with potatoes, peas, carrots and mayonnaise. While all the ingredients are the same, the way I make it&#39;s slightly different. Salad e Olivieh is the Persian equivalent of potato salad, I believe it has roots in Russia as well, there are a few different ingredients but it&#39;s very similar to the Persian version, this contains shredded chicken, potato salad does not usually contain meat, although I have seen some with ham.
