I have been having a recent issue with my baked salmon much longer than I&#39;d expect. I usually do it wrapped in foil, I am just wondering if you would expect the baking time to be longer than if you just. Layer salmon, tomato and basil on lightly oiled foil and wrap it all up — you can even do it a night before cooking. When the time for dinner comes, you can steam, grill, roast or pan-grill the packages. When I&#39;m pressed for time (or out camping), I often turn to wrapping food into little packets. 

So that is going to wrap it up with this special food foil wrapped salmon &amp; vegetable grill recipe. Thanks so much for reading. I am confident you can make this at home.
