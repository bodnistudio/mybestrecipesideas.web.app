- " Kosher salt"

recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse salmon under cold water and pat dry using paper towel."
- "In a container, pour sake over salmon, let it marinated for 10 minutes or so. Sake will help to eliminate the fishy smell in salmon."
- "Using paper towel, pat salmon dry. Sprinkle generous amount of salt on both sides of salmon fillet, especially on the skin."
- "Prepare a container with tight lid like this. Put paper towel inside, place the salmon fillet, then add another layer of paper towel on top. Close the lid."
- "Keep in the fridge for at least 24 hours. The longer you keep, the saltier it will become."
- "After 24 hours, take out the salmon. The paper towel should have been absorbing extra moisture from the salmon surface by now, so it will look somewhat dry. That&#39;s Ok"
- "Prepare your frying pan. Pour just a little amount of oil, and grill the fish on both sides until the skin becomes crispy and the flesh turned into peachy color."
- "Don&#39;t grill for too long, it will make the salmon texture gets hard &amp; tough."
- "If the salmon is ready, you can squeeze a bit of lemon juice on top if you like."
