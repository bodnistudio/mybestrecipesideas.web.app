The hardest part of onigiri-making is probably forming the rice balls. If you&#39;re having trouble with this step, try onigiri molds, which are special plastic molds (see Amazon) specifically intended for making onigiri. Along with triangles, squares, and circles, you can also find molds shaped like stars, bunny rabbits, flowers, dolphins, and more. Also known as o-musubi or nigirimeshi, onigiri are Japanese rice ball snacks made from cooked or steamed rice, seasonings (and sometimes tasty hidden fillings), wrapped a nori seaweed wrapper. In Japan, they&#39;re either made at home in the morning or purchased from a nearby kombini (convenience store), then taken to work or school as a tasty snack or quick lunch.
