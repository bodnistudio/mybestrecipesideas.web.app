Keep going until the last layer of potatoes are in the fry pan and flipped."
- "Add all the fried taters and veggies back to the pan and cover with cheese. Turn heat down to low or medium-low (you know your stove) and cover with a lid for ~3-5 mins until cheese is melted. Or if you prefer brown and bubbly, put your OVEN-SAFE pan under the broiler uncovered for a few minutes (DO NOT LEAVE UNSUPERVISED - or have really good home/renters insurance)"
- "Phew!!!! That was stressful! I need a drink."
- "Top your amazing taters and cheese with the cooked bacon. By this time you need a refill üç∏. Then plate and enjoy!"
