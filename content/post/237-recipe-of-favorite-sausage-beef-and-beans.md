Use a different type of bean, such as Great Northern beans, pinto beans, or regular kidney beans; Switch up the meaty protein and use ground pork sausage (drain off the extra fat), all beef hot dogs, ham, or bacon; Sub in or add other vegetables like mushrooms, kale, celery, potatoes, corn, or green beans.

Stir in rest of ingredients *except beans, until well mixed. Pour off juices accumulated on tops of cans and fold beans in gently until well combined. In same pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. We made the entire recipe without sausage, and then divided it. For the adults who liked sausage, we added the hot sausage, and for the kids and teens, we mixed in sliced hog dogs (an entire package), reserving some of the hot dog slices for the top of the beans, so they got crispy and dark.
