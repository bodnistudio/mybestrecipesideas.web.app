Iced green tea is great in the summer -- it&#39;s cool, it&#39;s got that slight bitter edge, and it&#39;s full of healthy antioxidants. You can keep this in a pitcher in the refrigerator and drink it whenever you need something to help you cool down. I make it with decaffeinated green tea so I don&#39;t get all wired. I have also made it using green tea with mint and that was excellent chilled.
