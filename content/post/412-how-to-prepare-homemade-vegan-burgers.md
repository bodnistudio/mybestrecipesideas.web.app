Low on beans, high on veggies, these vegetarian burgers have a substantial &#34;meaty&#34; texture that&#39;s moist but never soggy. Look for vegan bread (free of dairy or egg) and vegan condiments (free of ingredients like honey). If grilling, make sure that you oil your grill grates to prevent the veggie burgers from sticking. Since veggie burgers don&#39;t have the same natural juices and fat than a beef burger does, they have the potential to stick on the grates more.
