recipeingredient:
- " Sausage and Peppers  the BEST EVER"
- "1 packages sausages"
- "2-3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar"
- "1 medium onion sliced thin"
- "1 medium red pepper sliced"
- "1 medium green pepper sliced"
- "2 clove garlic  large cloves diced"
- "1 red pepper flakes to your liking"
- "1 can (14.5 oz.) can Italian flavored diced tomatoes strained keep liquid"
- "6 large mushrooms sliced"
- "1-3 tablespoons tomato paste"
- "1 tbsp butter"
- "1 Olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Let&#39;s talk about packaged sausages. Sausages are packaged 3 different ways - a full long link, a package of 6 or in bulk. When slicing full links use a measurement of about 1&#34;wide. The prepackaged links of 6 cut in thirds - this gives you little over 1&#34;. The bulk packaged sausages tend to be longer than the smaller package - these should be cut in fours. When in doubt size them up before cutting."
- "Use a 4 quart pot. Slice sausages and stab two opposite sides with knife tip. This prevents oil build up under the skin and also allows even cooking. Then place in pot with just enough water to cover; add 2-3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and set on high temp to boil. The more balsamic vinegar you add the more flavor you will have. When the water starts to boil turn it down to med-high."
- "The water will start to evaporate leaving a glaze. Turn the heat down and start stirring the sausages but do not brown them. Start to remove the sausages and drain them of grease (I use paper towels in a strainer and just swish them around)."
- "Turn down the heat to just below medium. Add onion and stir in a tablespoon of butter (at this point also add in a bit of olive oil to prevent burning). Any time you add vegetables always check to make sure they are not burning and adjust the heat. Add peppers and garlic stir and cook for about 3-4 mintues (keep checking temp on veggies)."
- "Add sausages back to vegetables along with strained tomatoes and sliced mushrooms. Stir to blend then cover and turn heat down to med-low."
- "After 3 minutes stir in tomato paste. Cover and cook about 3-4 minutes more. Check liquid (it will create a nice flavored sauce) in pot and if needed add some of the reserved tomato liquid. We are looking to create a thin sauce not watery which is why the tomato paste amount is varied. Turn down to almost a low heat and cook for an additional 15-20 minutes."
- "Serve with bread or over penne. My family likes penne - if you decide to use pasta once it is cooked combine the left over liquid to drained pasta before adding the sausage and peppers this provides more moisture. Enjoy!!"
