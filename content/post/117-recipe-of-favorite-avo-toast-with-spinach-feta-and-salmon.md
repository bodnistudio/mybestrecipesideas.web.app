Some flakey smoked salmon, some creamy smashed avo ‚Äî these two are SOULMATES. It&#39;s like tricking you into thinking you&#39;re being healthy cause it&#39;s ~feta~ and it&#39;s ~crumbled~ ‚Äî but really, just admit you have a cheese. This recipe makes salmon preparation simple while still introducing a gourmet touch. For an avocado still in its shell, a rectangle of feta that wouldn&#39;t even cover all the toast and a line of salt which is probably impossible to even pick up. Top with the second salmon fillet.
