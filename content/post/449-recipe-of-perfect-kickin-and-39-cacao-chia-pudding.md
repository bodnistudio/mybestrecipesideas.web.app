recipeingredient:
- "1 1/4 cup almond milk or alt milk of choice"
- "1/4 cup cacao powder"
- "1/4 cup chia seeds ground"
- "1 TBSP Coconut Palm sugar or choice of sweetener to taste"
- "1/2-1 tsp pumpkin spice see below for mix"
- "Pinch sea salt"
- " Sprinkle of pecans optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "You can leave your chia seeds whole, if you want a more &#34;tapioca&#34; type texture, but since this is &#34;chocolate&#34; pudding, I grind the chia seeds first. Sadly, I could not get them to grind at all with my granite mortar and pestle (like I do flax), so I use the flat blade of my MagicBullet. A clean electric coffee grinder or any flat blade processor could also be used."
- "Blend all ingredients together (I use regular blade on MB for this), then pour into small glass jars or serving bowls. I make 2-3 servings with this recipe."
- "Refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Add pecan pieces, if desired. Then enjoy the creamy, chocolatey, healthy goodness!"
- "&#34;Pumpkin spice&#34; is: 4 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp ginger, 1 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp allspice, all ground (of course!)"
