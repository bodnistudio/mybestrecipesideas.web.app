Iced coffee is a complicated thing, and there are many different approaches. One would think that one could merely pour brewed coffee into a glass full of ice and call it a dayâ€¦but I find that method extremely flawed. First, no matter how packed with ice the glass is, once the hot coffee hits, some of the ice is bound to melt. Iced coffee is a beverage that can really hit the spot, no matter the weather.

Iced coffee brewed with cold water can be bland, but of course, there are problems with hot water, too. If you pour your regular steaming hot coffee over ice, that ice melts, adding too much water. If you really want to get serious about your iced coffee, you can make ice cubes out of coffee too. Then you won&#39;t get that &#34;watered-down&#34; effect. And if you&#39;re into that flavored sort of coffee then go for it.
