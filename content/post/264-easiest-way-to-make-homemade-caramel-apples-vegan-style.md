recipeinstructions:
- "This is hardly a recipe and more of a combination that happens to taste extremely good if you use the right ingredients. They may not look like much, but they have been devoured very quickly at gatherings where I have served them as hor d&#39;oeuvres."
- "The apples MUST be organic or locally grown, as non organic tend to be quite dry. Select an apple that you would use for a regular taffy apple. Sweet, but not too sweet."
- "Mejdool dates are also an important choice, they are very sweet, and even chewy like caramel when you refrigerate them. Sorry for the extra notes, but it&#39;s important!"
- "CUT the apples into medium pieces, around 1&#34;/1&#34; on average."
- "Remove the pits from the Dates and cut them in 4 pieces."
- "Simply connect a piece of date to a piece of apple with a tooth pick. When the date piece is slightly smaller than the apple piece you pin it to, that works best but don&#39;t worry too much about it really."
- "Put these healthy hor d&#39;oeuvres on a plate and serve."
- "That&#39;s it! Simple, yet the combination is great, very similar to a caramel apple in fact."
