recipeingredient:
- "2 Wiener sausages or bacon"
- "1/4 Onion"
- "1 small Potatoes"
- "2 cm Carrot"
- "2 tbsp Cream Stew Roux granule type"
- "1 tsp Grated cheese"
- "100 ml Milk"
- "1 dash Salt and pepper"
- "1/2 tsp Consomm soup stock"
- "300 ml Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Thinly julienne the carrot and potato, slice the onion, slice the wieners into round, and combine everything into a pot."
- "Slice the asparagus diagonally into 1 cm pieces."
- "Add water, milk, salt, pepper, and consommé in the pot from Step 1 and turn on the heat. After it begins to boil, it could boil over very quickly, so right before it comes to a full boil, lower the heat to medium-low."
- "Once the vegetables have cooked through (about 3-4 minutes), add the asparagus, roux, and grated cheese. Mix together and let it simmer for about 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally."
- "When it thickens, check if the asparagus has cooked through. If the taste seems a little thin, add more consommé, and then it&#39;s done. Serve in a bowl and sprinkle ground pepper if you like."
- "It&#39;s also delicious with spinach or green peas instead of asparagus."
- "I used the granule type of roux this time since it&#39;s easier to dissolve, but if you don&#39;t have any, you can make it with one piece of the normal solid variety."
