Hey everyone, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to make a special dish, greek yogurt ice-cream. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

1. Take 1 greek yogurt (150ml)
1. Get 50 g frozen berries (preferably sour cherries)
1. Make ready 10 g chia seed
1. Get 5 g chocolate topping


Tools you need: An ice cream maker (we love our Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer Attachment) Patience! Between getting the ice cream maker to the correct temperature and letting the frozen yogurt set, it takes some time but it is so worth it for your own delicious, homemade frozen yogurt. Print Oh yeah, freezing greek yogurt will not produce the popular and well-known ice cream dessert. Frozen yogurt ice cream requires some additional ingredients.
