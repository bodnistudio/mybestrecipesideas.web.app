##### The ingredients needed to make Creamy Potato Apple Salad:

1. Get 2 Fuji apples, sliced to bite size
1. Get 1 stalk (w/ or w/o leaves) Celery, minced
1. Take 1 bunch Parsley, minced
1. Get 4 Potatoes, boiled &amp; peeled
1. Make ready 1 sml can Pineapple triangles, drained
1. Get 1 box nestle cream
1. Get 1 square packet mayonnaise, ladies choice
1. Prepare 1 carrot, diced
1. Get 1 bunch green onion, garnish cut (optional)


Letting the potatoes soak with the water or broth and a bit of apple cider vinegar makes all of the ingredients marinate together better, and produces a seriously creamy potato salad. Most potato salads look and taste better when made with low-starch red boiling potatoes. There&#39;s no creamy dressing on a vinegar-based potato salad like Dill Potato Salad. This type of salad is quite different from the one with a creamy base, but it is also served cold.
