Beef stock is more meaty flavored than beef broth and gets its richness from beef bones that have been stripped of their meat for common cuts of beef. As the bones cook in regular old water, they release gelatin (or collagen) that thickens the broth/stock and imparts that lovely beefy flavor. Once boiling, turn the heat down to the lowest simmer possible. Add the beef and any juices from the bowl and thyme sprig.

OMG it was so good and now I&#39;m planning to make another batch of broth. The only thing I would suggest is when straining the beef stock, remove the bones and squeeze the leftover content in the cheesecloth to get out all the good flavour from the vegetables and beef chunks. The broth was good prior to this but it was so much better with this. The best thing about beef stock, also known as brown stock, is its high gelatinization content which makes for a rich, flavorful stock that cannot be matched by any other stock. It is my favorite and the most highly sought stock because the sauces that you can make from a beef stock is unmatched.
