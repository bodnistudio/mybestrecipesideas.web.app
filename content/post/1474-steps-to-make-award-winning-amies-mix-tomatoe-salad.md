This is the classic preparation for tomato salad in Germany. This is my husband Tommy&#39;s favorite summer meal, especially on those nights it&#39;s too hot to cook. We get a loaf of crusty bread, sometimes we even toast it and rub a raw garlic clove on the bread. Then eat the tomatoes and let the bread sop up all those delicious juices at the bottom (so good you&#39;ll want to drink it!).

Fresh basil with tomato is a match made in heaven, plus thin slices of red onion for freshness then a simple vinaigrette made with cider vinegar, olive oil and mustard for thickening.
