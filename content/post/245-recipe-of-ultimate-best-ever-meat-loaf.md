I originally found it in my Cook&#39;s. This traditional meatloaf recipe is just like mom used to make, made with ground beef and a sweet and tangy glaze topping. I think the trick to good meatloaf is using lean ground beef. The problem with a lot of meatloaf recipes is that they call for ground beef with a high fat content. Your Meatloaf recipe is by far the best Meatloaf I have ever ever had.
