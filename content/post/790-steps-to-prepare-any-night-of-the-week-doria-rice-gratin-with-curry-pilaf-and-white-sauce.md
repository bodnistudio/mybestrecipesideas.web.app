recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare for 2 servings of curry pilaff. Slice the tomato into 1 cm thickness. Cut the broccoli into bite sizes and cook until al dente."
- "Mix the ★ panko and curry powder. Use curry powder without extra seasonings. The curry powder with extra seasonings burns quickly."
- "Melt butter over low heat. Add plain flour and stir well to remove lumps. At first you might think it&#39;s too thick, but it will get runny by stirring with a whisk while cooking."
- "After the roux is smooth, add milk little by little and stir constantly. At first it hardens as you add milk, but it will soften gradually. Ensure that there are no lumps and add the rest of the milk."
- "Add a bay leaf if you have for flavouring. Stir constantly until comes to a boil and thickens. Adjust the taste with the ☆ seasonings and the white sauce is done."
- "If you don&#39;t use the sauce straight away, cover tightly with cling film directly on top of the mixture to prevent a film from forming."
- "Preheat the oven to 445-480°F/230-250°C."
- "Put the curry pilaf in an oven-proof dish and pour over the white sauce to cover. Put the tomato, broccoli and easy melting cheese. Sprinkle the ★ panko on top."
- "Put the dish on the top shelf of the oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes until the cheese is melted and browned."
- "It&#39;s very nice to eat while piping hot. Just don&#39;t burn yourself."
- "You can use a toaster oven, but by baking it in the oven, the tomatoes will turn out juicier from the slow baking time. In this photo I used cherry tomatoes."
