It is a culinary dish prepared with stacked layers of pasta modified with sauces and ingredients such. From Italian lasagna (and its plural lasagne), possibly from Vulgar Latin *lasania, from Latin lasanum (&#34;cooking pot&#34;), from Ancient Greek λάσανον (lásanon, &#34;trivet or stand for a pot&#34;). Others argue the Italian lasagna originally derived from the Arabic لَوْزِينَج‎ (lawzīnaj, &#34;almond cake&#34;). Pasta noodles piled high and layered full of three kinds of cheese to go along with the perfect blend of meaty and zesty, tomato pasta sauce all loaded with herbs.
