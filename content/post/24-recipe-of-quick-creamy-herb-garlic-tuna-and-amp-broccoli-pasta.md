Unfortunately, this did not really develop into a sauce, all of the herbs rose to the top rather than being incorporated into the sauce, and it was simply runny and weak/diluted in flavor. Try this recipe with the Gold Seas Herb &amp; Garlic variant, it&#39;s my favorite by far! Mix milk and cream cheese together in a medium bowl with an electric mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment until creamy. Add remaining ingredients and mix well, scraping sides of bowl constantly. Place in an airtight container and refrigerate for at least one hour to allow the flavors to blend.
