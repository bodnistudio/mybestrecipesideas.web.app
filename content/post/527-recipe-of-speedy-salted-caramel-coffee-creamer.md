Homemade Salted Caramel Coffee Creamer I&#39;ve been in the mood to experiment with my homemade coffee creamers lately. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love my old stand-by French Vanilla Creamer that I make, but with the changing seasons I&#39;ve been in the mood for a richer, creamier taste. Inspired by the tastes of Salted Caramel Mochaâ€”our signature seasonal beverage. We crafted our creamer with cocoa and sweet caramel flavors, and added a hint of salt to pair perfectly with our coffee for a salty and sweet treat. Into a saucepan over medium-high heat, add the water and the sugar.
