<h3>Steps to make Pumpkin Pie, Winter Luxury:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Yield: One 9-inch deep dish pie or two 8-inch shallow pies. Preheat oven to 350 degrees..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Wash the exterior of the pumpkin in cool or warm water, no soap..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cut the pumpkin in half. A serrated knife and a sawing motion works best - a smooth knife is more likely to slip..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Scrape the insides. You want to get out that stringy, dangly stuff that coats the inside surface. Note: can save seeds to cook separately..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place it cut side down into a covered oven container. Fill container with 3/4&#34; water. Cover the ovenproof container (with a lid), and pop it in a 350 F (165 C) oven. 

It normally takes about 45 minutes to 90 minutes (it can vary a lot!); just test it periodically by sticking it with a fork to see if it is soft!.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Scoop out the cooked pumpkin..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Puree the pumpkin.

To get a nice, smooth consistency, I use a Pillsbury hand blender. By blending it, you give the pie a smooth, satiny texture; rather than the rough graininess that is typical of cooked squashes.

Note: You may freeze the puree or pie filling to use it later! Just use a freezer bag or other container to exclude as much air as possible. It should last a year or more in a deep freezer..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Mix in all ingredients. Make the pie crust (I use Pillsbury)

It is also time to start preheating the oven. Turn it on and set it to 425 F..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake at 425 F for the first 15 minutes, then turn the temperature down to 350 F and bake another 45 to 60 minutes, until a clean knife inserted into the center comes out clean..
			
			
		</li>
	
</ol>

<p>
	
		When cut into a wedge on a plate, it holds its shape, color, &amp; flavor long after the competition has keeled.
	
		Porcelain Doll&#39;s deep-orange, sweet flesh can be used for pies, soup, and gourmet culinary delights.
	
		Buy Winter Luxury Pie pumpkin seeds in packet to bulk quantities.
	
		We stock a wide range of pumpkin seeds.
	
		Thick flesh and small seed cavity (see pic).
