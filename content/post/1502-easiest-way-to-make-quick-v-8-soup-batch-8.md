It&#39;s one of the best ways to use up leftover frozen summer produce (squash, corn, zucchini, etc) and it&#39;s a good meal to put on for the day- just a few minutes prep work and. A great veggie soup quick to prepare and freezes great!!! Hamburger vegetable soup with potatoes gets even tastier as it sits in the fridge. Try making a double batch and eating it for several meals throughout the week.
