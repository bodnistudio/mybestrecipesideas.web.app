- "Cut the ham and cucumber into thin strips. In a bowl, combine all the ingredients for the dressing except roasted sesame seeds and add in the ham and cucumber!"
- "Beat the eggs. In a pan, heat oil over medium high heat and spread in enough eggs to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook until the bottom side of the egg is firm.

- "Sprinkle with the roasted sesame seeds and you&#39;re done! I made double when I took the picture."
