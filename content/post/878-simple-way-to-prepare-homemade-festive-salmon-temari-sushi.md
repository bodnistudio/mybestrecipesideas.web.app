recipeinstructions:
- "I used this thinly sliced salmon this time."
- "Make the sushi vinegar: Put the vinegar, sugar and salt in a small pan, and warm up while stirring to dissolve the sugar. (This one is brown because I used 100% rice vinegar.)"
- "Put the freshly cooked hot rice in a bowl or similar, and swirl on the sushi vinegar."
- "Cut and fold to mix with a rice paddle, taking care not to mash the rice grains."
- "When the sushi vinegar is evenly mixed in, and there are no lumps of rice, fan it to cool it down. This will make the sushi rice very shiny."
- "Spread out a piece of plastic wrap on a scale, and place the sashimi on top. Since the sashimi I used this time was very thin I used 2 slices. If you have thicker slices of sashimi, 1 is fine."
- "Set the scale to 0 (use the TARE function if you&#39;re using a digital scale) and put on 50 g of sushi rice. The rice sticks to the spoon, so dip the spoon in water each time. Add wasabi if you like."
- "Twist the wrap tightly, and form a nice round ball. Keep the sushi wrapped in plastic to prevent it from drying out until it&#39;s time to serve them."
- "Arrange them just before eating them. Top with capers to finish. Just one caper per piece made them look like shumai dumplings to me, so I put on 2 per piece."
- "You can also form the sushi by putting a caper on the plastic wrap, then the sashimi, followed by the rice."
