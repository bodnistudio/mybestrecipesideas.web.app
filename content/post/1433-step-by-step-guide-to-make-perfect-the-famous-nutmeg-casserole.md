I left my job as a stockbroker to start Nutmeg because I was frustrated by the exclusivity and lack of transparency in the investment world — and I knew I was not the only one.

Chicken Parmesan Casserole is a dish that took some convincing in our household at first. This isn&#39;t a dish I&#39;ve ever made for a client but looking. To make this casserole, I used the delicious Fresh Farmer&#39;s Cheese that I&#39;d just made, but if you didn&#39;t have access to that, you could use a good quality, well-sourced firm Ricotta Cheese.
