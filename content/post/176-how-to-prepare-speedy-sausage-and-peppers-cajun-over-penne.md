Add peppers and onions to the bowl and toss to coat in oil mixture. I think every Italian family makes this dish, with slight variations of course, within their own family traditions. Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil in a large pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Remove from the pan and place on a plate lined with paper towels to cool. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if desired.
