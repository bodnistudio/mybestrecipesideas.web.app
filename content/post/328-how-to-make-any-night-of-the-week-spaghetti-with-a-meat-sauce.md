Tip Authentic Italian Style Spaghetti Sauce simmered low and slow and packed with flavor! In my opinion I think there are a few key steps in creating that authentic, thick, richly flavored, meaty sauce. I&#39;ve learned a few things trying to imitate that amazingly delicious pasta sauce that I get at a few of my favorite Italian restaurants. A-spaghetti without a-cheese is like a-kiss without a-squeeze, and spaghetti without good sauce is like…well, limp, hopeless noodles. This spaghetti sauce…is good sauce, my friends.
