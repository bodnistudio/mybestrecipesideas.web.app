<h3>Steps to make Easy fish pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Peel and chop the potatoes into small chunks. Place in a pan of boiling, slightly salted water and bring to the boil. Simmer for approx. 10 minute until they are cooked through. Drain thoroughly and add the butter and a dash of milk. Mash well and put aside..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Peel the carrot and grate into an medium overproof dish. Grate or thinkly slice the leeks and add to the dish..
			
			
		</li>

Add a little of the milk and stir to incorporate the roux and the liquid. You will need to keep doing this until all the milk is added, making sure there are no lumps in the sauce. A whisk may help you do this..
