recipeingredient:
- "1 Chrysanthemum greens and mushrooms shimeji etc"
- "1 Salmon filet raw not salted"
- "3 or so 7 mm thick slices Onion"
- " The miso sauce for 2 servings"
- "1 heaping tablespoon Miso"
- "2 heaping teaspoons Sugar"
- "2 tsp Honmirin real mirin"
- "1 1/2 tsp Sake"
- "1 tsp Soy sauce"
- "2 to 3 tablespoons Finely chopped green onion"
- "1 tbsp Grated ginger"
- "1 touch or to your liking Grated garlic"
- "1 tbsp Coarsely ground sesame seeds"
- "2 pinch Shichimi spice"
recipeinstructions:
- "These are the ingredients for 1 serving. The sauce is for 2 servings though, so don&#39;t use it all."
- "Wash the salmon quickly and dry well. Season lightly with salt and white pepper, and sprinkle with a little sake. (These are not listed in the ingredients.)"
- "Make the sauce. The garlic is used to counteract the &#39;raw&#39; flavor of the salmon. You won&#39;t taste it though."
- "Mix all the sauce ingredients together..."
- "It&#39;s pretty thick. So let&#39;s wrap the fish! Spread out a pretty generous piece of foil. There&#39;s no need to oil it. No need to wipe the sake off the salmon."
- "Line the foil with the onion slices, and top with some of the miso sauce. Layer on the salmon, and more sauce."
- "Put the mushrooms and leek (the white part) on the sides, and add the greens last."
- "Cut another piece of foil. Put it on top, and tightly close up the sides."
- "Heat a frying pan over low-medium heat. No lid needed!"
- "Cook like this for 15 minutes. The miso and onion will burn a bit on the bottom, and smell very nice."
- "When you smell it toasting, that means it&#39;s done. Transfer to a serving plate and rip off the foil. (This part is exciting!) Done!"
- "The burned onions are so delicious... You can make this on the stovetop, so in the winter you&#39;re killing two birds with one stone. If it starts to smell a bit toasted, you should probably take it out before it burns!"
