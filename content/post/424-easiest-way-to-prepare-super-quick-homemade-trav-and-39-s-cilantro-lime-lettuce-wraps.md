I&#39;ve tried other lettuce wrap recipes and hands down, this one comes the closest to PF Chang&#39;s chicken lettuce wraps. Ground chicken is the way to go. I didn&#39;t add the sriracha as I don&#39;t like the taste. I love lettuce wraps because they are healthy, low-fat, low-carb, and skinny. I&#39;ve been stuffing my face with these non-stop, guilt free because they are low-carb.
