By Monica Matheny Skip the photo tutorial - Jump straight to the recipe. When you don&#39;t have the time or money for a freshly brewed Starbucks vanilla latte, this instant mix is a convenient, affordable option.. The taste of the Instant Caffè Mocha Latte isn&#39;t that great. It lacks flavor (compared to what you buy at an actual Starbucks), but if you need a &#34;quick fix&#34; and can&#39;t get to your local Starbucks for the real thing, it could work.
