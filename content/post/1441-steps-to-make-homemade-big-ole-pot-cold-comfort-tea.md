Having lived up in Maine and Massachusetts for many years, this was a dish I often made on cold and snowy days. &#34;I brew a big ol&#39; pot of strong, strong coffee (Philz coffee beans) every few nights and keep it in an old glass milk jar in the fridge. Make sure the thighs aren&#39;t over crowding the pot. Remove thighs and place on a plate. Place the chicken breasts, the carrots, onion, celery, bay leaves, chicken bouillon granules, cream of chicken soup and salt in a dutch oven or similar big pan or stock pot and just cover with water. Bring this to a boil, reduce to simmer and cook covered for about an hour and a half or two hours.
