I didn&#39;t have any winter squash, but I added baby carrots &amp; sliced zucchini. One thing I did different, I put the root vegetables (onion, potatoes &amp; carrots) in one bowl &amp; the more delicate vegetables (peppers &amp; zucchini) in another bowl, they I divided the oil/vinegar/herb mixture between the two bowls. Roasting vegetables is the best way to cook them in our opinion, and the easiest way to get people to eat more veggies. This Roasted Vegetable Winter Salad is a salad for people that think salads aren&#39;t filling or they think they are boring. Make Ahead: Store roasted vegetables in a zip-top plastic freezer bag or an airtight container in the fridge.
