A smoky, sweet and spicy rub adds instant flavor to this tender cut of beef. Santa Maria style tri-tip takes a tender, and mild cut of beef then coats the roast with a blast of spices on the surface for maximum flavor. To oven-roast a tri-tip, prepare meat with rub and refrigerate as instructed. On stovetop, heat on high until pan is very hot, then add tri-tip, fat side down. Remove from oven (don&#39;t forget to turn off the oven, like me).
