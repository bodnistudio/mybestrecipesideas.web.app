Hey everyone, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to make a distinctive dish, perfect iced coffee. One of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Iced coffee is a complicated thing, and there are many different approaches. One would think that one could merely pour brewed coffee into a glass full of ice and call it a day…but I find that method extremely flawed.
