- "Add mushrooms to pan. Sprinkle with thyme. Cook until mushrooms begin to soften, stirring frequently. About 5 minutes."

- "Serve with mashed potatoes and a side salad to complete your tasty meal. Enjoy!"
- "Note: As always, taste for seasoning before serving. I usually give the mushrooms a light sprinkling of salt and pepper as they cook, but almost never add salt beyond that point. It&#39;s up to you to determine how you want it seasoned."
