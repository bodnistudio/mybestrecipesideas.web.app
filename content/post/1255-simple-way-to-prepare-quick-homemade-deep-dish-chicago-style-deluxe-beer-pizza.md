recipeingredient:
- " For the pizza dough"
- "1 bottle Leinenkugel summer shandy"
- "3 cups unbleached bread flour"
- "1 cup whole wheat bread flour"
- "2.5 tablespoons active dry yeast"
- "1.5 tablespoons mustard powder"
- "1 tablespoon garlic powder"
- "1 tablespoon ground pepper black or white"
- " For the pizza"
- "1 cup mozzarella cheese"
- "1 cup mushrooms"
- "1 large onion"
- "handful pepperoni"
- "1 cup pizza sauce"
- "1 teaspoon Minced garlic"
- "1 tablespoon brown sugar"
- "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar"
- " pizza seasoning blend"
- " Olive Oil"
- " Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, make the dough by mixing together both flours, yeast, mustard powder, ground pepper and garlic powder. Then slowly pour your beer in from a low height so it doesn&#39;t produce many bubbles making it easier to mix. Continue mixing adding water along the way until dough is sticky, self contained and there is no flour left in the bowl. Let rest for 8-12 hours."
- "Pour a tablespoon of olive over over your raised dough, and mix it in thoroughly. Let dough rise for another 30 minutes before dividing the total mix into 3 equal pieces. Kneed each piece on a well flowered surface and store in a ziploc bag in the fridge for another 12 hours before use."
- "Oil up a deep cast iron skillet, press your dough into it trying to form a crust as you go. In the meantime preheat your oven to 450 degrees and let your dough rise while you prepare the toppings."
- "Place pepperoni between sheets of paper towel on a microwave safe dish and microwave for 1 minute to get most of the juices out. Prepare carmelized Onions and sautéed mushrooms (I have recipes in my profile) being sure not to over cook them, and keeping their moisture to a minimum."
- "Press the crust of the dough up once more, then add your cheese in an even layer on the bottom. Form a layer of pepperoni and spread your onions and mushrooms evenly over top, then add your sauce over top. Add parmesian cheese or pizza seasonings to the top for extra flavor."
- "Bake on 450 degrees for: 20mins = for soft crust; 25mins = for perfect crust; or 30 mins = for well done crust. Let sit for 10 minutes before cutting into and enjoy!"
