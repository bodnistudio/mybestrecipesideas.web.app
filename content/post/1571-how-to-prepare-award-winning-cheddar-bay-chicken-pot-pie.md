<h3>Steps to make Cheddar bay chicken pot pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			In 11x8 glass baking dish, lay the crescent rolls (in a whole sheet) across the bottom and slightly up the sides. You might want to use pan coating but isn&#39;t necessary since to bake the rolls requires no coating on the pan in original instructions. I did use a little. Just in case..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cut the chicken breast into bite sized pieces and cook in a pan with a little salt and pepper and a couple cloves of crushed garlic..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			When the chicken is almost done add the vegetables. Cut the vegetables into bite sized pieces as well. While this is cooking mix the biscuits. Also in another bowl take the soup and mix it with 3/4 can of milk..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cook veg with the chicken for about 15 minutes or until the carrots are tender-crisp. Add the soup mixture to the chicken/veg..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Should be about like this.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Take the cheddar bay biscuit mix you made and, I used my fingers, add it to the top. Like this.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake at 400Â° for about 25-30 minutes. Check to make sure the biscuit top is done. When you remove it from the oven, take the garlic butter (from the cheddar bay biscuit mix) you have and brush it on top..
