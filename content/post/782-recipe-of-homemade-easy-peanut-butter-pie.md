This is my go-to pie recipe for carry-in events and holidays because you can quickly make it using a store bought graham cracker crust and a few simple ingredients. The amount of peanut butter in this filling is about double what many recipes call for. I upped it because I wanted the peanut butter to be more than a suggestion. Not only does the additional peanut butter add flavor, it also makes for a much richer filling — but one that still melts in your mouth. The pie includes chocolate pastry cream, peanut butter filling and slices of banana in a crust made of graham cracker crumbs, dry roasted peanuts and pretzels.
