1. Prepare 5 grams Ginger Garlic Paste
1. Prepare 5 ml Soya Sauce (Optional)
1. Get 5 grams Chilly Paste

Make barbecue sauce: In a large bowl, combine ketchup, brown sugar, water, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire, molasses, and spices. I love BBQ chicken from the grill as much as anyone, but if we&#39;re being really honest here, it is kind of time-consuming to do well. You&#39;ve got to cook the chicken pretty perfectly without the sauce, and once the sauce is added you have to spend a lot of time flipping and basting to get that burnished-but-not-burned coating we all crave. OK, yes, I&#39;m a big dork but I love getting first review so just shake your heads, let it pass, and let me enjoy my moment. ;P The KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) invasion in the US is now in full swing and the latest to join the fray is BBQ Chicken in Buena Park.
