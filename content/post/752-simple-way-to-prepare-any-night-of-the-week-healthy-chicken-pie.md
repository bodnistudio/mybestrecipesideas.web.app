		The classic chicken pot pie is usually made with: a buttery puff pastry pie crust, butter, flour, chicken broth, milk, chicken meat (or turkey) and vegetables (carrots, celery, peasâ€¦).
	
		In my version you&#39;ll find a light, flaky phyllo dough instead of puff pastry , tiny bit of oil instead of a large amount of butter and some good homemade.
	
		This healthy chicken pie is easy to make and still feels like a proper pie - even though it&#39;s lower in calories.
