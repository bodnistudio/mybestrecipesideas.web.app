The ginger in lemon and ginger tea contains gingerol. Though this classic recipe is called a tea, it&#39;s really an infusion of fresh ginger and lemon â€” nothing &#34;tea&#34; about it other than how healthful it is and how soothing it is to drink. Plus, it&#39;s homemade fresh right in your own kitchen. Ginger is known for it&#39;s potential stomach calming and inflammation reducing qualities, thus the quieting of the fluttery stomach, and lemon is healthful. Hi John, the ginger lemon tea we&#39;re covering here is technically an infusion, and not the same as a tea made with actual tea leaves or herbs.
