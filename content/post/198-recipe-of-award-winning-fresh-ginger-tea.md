Hello everybody, it's me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, fresh ginger tea. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

1. Prepare 1 tsp lemon zest (1/2 lemon)
1. Prepare 1 tsp honey


This recipe brightens up the flavor with fresh lime juice and sweetens it with honey. Ginger tea made from scratch may seem daunting, but it&#39;s actually super simple. Fresh ginger tea made from scratch is a whole lot better than ginger tea from a tea bag. A little lemon (for vitamin C) and honey (to soothe the throat and to sweeten) makes it tasty.
