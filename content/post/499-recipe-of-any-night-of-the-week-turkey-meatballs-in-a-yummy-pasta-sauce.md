For the sauce I recommend you use dried herbs. I served this over rice but it would also be delicious over pasta. Good-quality store bought pasta sauce is one of my more adored pantry staples. You can warm the sauce in a small pot on the stove then spoon it over the cooked meatballs, or take our favorite approach: warm the sauce in a larger, wider pan, then toss the Baked Turkey Meatballs in the sauce at the end. To make the sauce, cook chopped garlic and crushed red pepper flakes in olive oil then add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and basil.
