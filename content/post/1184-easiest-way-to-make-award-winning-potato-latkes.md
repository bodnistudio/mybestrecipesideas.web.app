recipeinstructions:
- "(One egg per potato) Crack the eggs into a medium-sized bowl. Add in pepper and salt and whip with fork. Have it be saltier than desired as the potatoes will absorb some salt."
- "Grate or pulverize the onion into the egg mixture. (Pictured is the grater I use.)"
- "Peel and grate the potatoes into the eggs - this helps prevent the potatoes from browning."
- "Heat up a skillet or frying pan with olive oil or an oil of your choice. Scoop out some latkeh mixture and shape it more on the thin side for a crunchiness. Be careful with making it too thick/heavy. It will be harder to flip over and is more likely to crumble."
- "Keep experimenting to get your desired texture :) We made it a bit too thick this time around- so it tasted like delicious potato kugel!"
