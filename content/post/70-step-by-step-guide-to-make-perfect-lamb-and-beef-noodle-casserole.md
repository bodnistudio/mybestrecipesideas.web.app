Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. While browning the beef I seasoned it with onion powder, garlic powder, freshly ground black pepper, and a smidge of salt. I chopped up one small onion, and after draining the beef I mixed the beef, cream of mushroom soup, and chopped onions together and let them simmer a bit. Pour a thick layer of bechamel on top of the noodles, to the top of the casserole dish (there may be a little leftover).
