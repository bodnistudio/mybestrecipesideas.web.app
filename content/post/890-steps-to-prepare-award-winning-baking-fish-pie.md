	<strong>Baking fish pie</strong>. 
	It was also thick enough to bind the fish nicely together, making a definite bottom layer to the pie. Baking the potatoes instead of boiling them before mashing them was a new technique for me but one I will now use frequently (I did bake mine in the microwave which saved a lot of time). The result a tasty browned topping on a succulent fish base.

<h3>Steps to make Baking fish pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			(Dough) 1Kg plain flour
500g butter (500ml cooking butter)
1/2 tsp. salt
2 tsp. baking powder

		<li>
			In a clean bowl pour and mix in the flour, salt, baking powder, then add the butter. When its all combined, start adding in the water a little at a time; until all the flour mix come together. Rap the dough in a cling film or in a nylon carrier, then place in the fridge for about an hour… can be left for longer if preferred.

* clean out the mackerel and cook for 6mins without any salt. When it all cooked, drain out the excess water, let the fish cool down then debone the fish..

		<li>
			Place oils in a frying pan, put in the tomatoes, onions and potatoes let it cook for a 5mins, then add in the water, maggi, pepper and salt… cover and let it cook. This is necessary as the potatoes needs to cook until very soft, this may take up to 20mins, it all depends on the potatoes used.. When the potatoes is all cooked, add in your fish, taste (add more salt if need) and finally add in the flour to thicken the sauce. Cook leave for extra 3mins… then leave to chill.

			. preheat the oven to 250 degree Celsius. Bring out the dough, knead for 2mins, roll out the dough with a rolling pin to about 4mm thickness, with a round plate cut out circles

Scoop in 1 1/2 tbsp. of the filing on to the dough, dab edges with whisked egg.. then fold into half, with a fork press all around the folded edge..

		I saw a similar pie on a jamie Oliver program, and decided to give it a try when I was given a fish last night.
	
		I oven baked our fish in foil, saving the juices, and replacing a little of the wine with them.
	
		Combining fish, leeks, milk, butter, and potatoes, a fish pie is a one-pot supper dish.
	
		Some like to sprinkle a fish pie with grated cheese but that&#39;s optional, as is the addition of hard-cooked eggs seen in some recipes.
	
		Serve fish pie with peas or other fresh greens.
