- "1 tablespoon dill"
- "1 bunch parsley"
- "1 lemon"
- "1 lime"
- "3 large potatoes"
- "1 cup canola oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by removing the bones from the fish of your choice and cutting to size - I used a basa fillet and cut it in half."
- "Combine the juice of both the lemon and lime in a bowl along with the dill and parsley, both coarsely chopped. Add garlic and chilli to your liking."
- "Now marinade the fish in the lemon/lime mixture for about 20mins-30mins."
- "Whilst the fish is marinading, begin to prep the batter by combining the cornflour, beer and buttermilk in a bowl - briskly whisk until smooth. Salt and pepper to taste."

- "Slice the potatoes into thick &#34;matchsticks&#34; and softly boil for 3 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool."

- "Once the oil is hot enough place your battered fish into the pan, letting each side cook for 2 minutes per side or until golden brown."
- "Place the fish to the side to rest while you cook the chips - the oil should still be warm enough for you to place the precut chips in the pan immediately."
- "Once chips are nice and crispy, drain away the oil and place on a plate with the rested fish - garnish with a sprig of parsley and a lemon wedge."
