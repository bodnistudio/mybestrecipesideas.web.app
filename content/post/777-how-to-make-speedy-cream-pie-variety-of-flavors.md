Great Place to Try It: Mrs. The cream filling gains a rich, yellow color from its namesake fruit, and the texture of the bananas lends itself very well to a cream pie. Due to their more subtle flavor, bananas actually provide a more nuanced flavor profile, one that is hard to replicate with other fruits. For all these reasons, banana cream pie wins against all other cream. All our custards and fillings are made with real ingredients, like cream, sugar and butter.
