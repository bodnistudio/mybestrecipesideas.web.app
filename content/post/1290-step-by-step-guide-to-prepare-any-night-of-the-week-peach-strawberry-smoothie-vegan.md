To make this smoothie super creamy, I used Silk&#39;s Unsweetened Cashew Milk and added raw, hulled hemp seeds for some protein. I don&#39;t like adding sweetener or juice to my smoothies, because I find the fruit sweet enough. But, if you like a sweeter smoothie, add frozen bananas to each layer, or soaked dates! If desired, set aside a few strawberry slices for garnish.
