<h3>Instructions to make Caramel and Banana Mille-Feuille Using Pie Crusts:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Use a fork to poke holes all over the pie crusts and bake in a 220°C - 180°C oven for 25 minutes. After 6 - 7 minutes, use a spatula to deflate the puffiness..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Dust the entire crust with powdered sugar sprinkled through a tea strainer, and bake again for 3 - 4 minutes at 230°C..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Once the entire surface has become a glossy caramel color, it&#39;s done..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Put the granulated sugar from A into a pot and heat on medium..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			When it turns a thick, dark caramel color, stop the heat and add the heavy cream.from A. Stir together..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			This is what it looks like after the cream has been added..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the milk and bring to a boil. It&#39;s okay if the caramel begins to stick to the bottom of the pot because it will gradually dissolve..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a bowl, mix together the egg yolk, granulated sugar, and sifted flour + cornstarch mixture, in that order..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add Step 7 into Step 8 and blend together. Pour it back into the pot and turn on the heat to medium-high. While using a whisk to stir, heat until the center comes to a boil and it is completely heated through..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pour it into a metal tray, cover with plastic wrap, top with an ice pack and cool quickly. This completes the caramel custard..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Mix together all of the B. ingredients in a bowl. Place the bowl in a bowl of ice water and lightly whip until fluffy peaks are formed..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Strain Step 10 and stir in the rum. Add 40g of Step 11 to Step 10 and fold it in with a rubber spatula..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cut the pie crust into 6 sections. Using a serrated knife, first cut just the caramel&#39;s surface, then vigorously push the knife down to cut through the rest..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Use a piping bag with a star-shaped tip to pipe cream from Step 12 onto the 6 pie crust strips..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Top with 5mm thick roundly sliced bananas. It&#39;s difficult to move them after this, so you should put them on a serving dish..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pipe the rest of the heavy cream in a straight line..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Top with the remaining 6 pie crusts and it&#39;s all done!.
