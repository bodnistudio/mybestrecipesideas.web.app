recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the eggplant and cut one side to make flat surface. This will stabilize your eggplant when you slice it. Slice the eggplant thinly."
- "Now salt the eggplant slices on both sides set in a bowl to drain the liquids. Doing this take all or most of the bitterness out of the eggplant slices.

- "Add the olive oil to the eggplant. Cook on a cooking surface. Turn as needed. In a baking pan add some of the eggplant. I used a spring form pan."
- "Add some of the meatballs cut side down. Cover the meatballs with half the sauce. Now add the pesto on top of sauce."
- "Repeat the the same layers except you shouldn&#39;t have pesto on second layer. Add the shredded cheese on top. Put into the oven for 45 minutes."
- "Take out of oven and let rest 15 minutes. Serve I hope you enjoy!!!!"
