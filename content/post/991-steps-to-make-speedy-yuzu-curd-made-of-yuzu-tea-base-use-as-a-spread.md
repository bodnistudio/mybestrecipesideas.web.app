- "150 grams Yuzu tea base"
- "1 See my yuzu tea base recipe"
- "2 Egg yolks"
- "2 tbsp Maple syrup or honey or you can leave both out"
- "60 grams Unsalted butter"
- " If you are making this with fresh yuzu rather than yuzu tea base use the ingredients below instead of the yuzu tea base plus the  ingredients listed above"
- "1 Yellow ripe yuzu"
- "80 grams Sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sterilize the storage jar in boiling water beforehand, and dry completely."
- "Only if you are using fresh yuzu fruit: Rub the surface of the yuzu with salt to clean, rinse in water, submerge the yuzu briefly in boiling water and drain."
- "If you are using fresh yuzu citrus: Put the de-seeded yuzu, peel, insides and all into a heavy pan. Add water to cover, and heat."
- "Please skim off any scum."
- "Only if you are using fresh yuzu: When the water reduces to about 1/3 of its original amount, transfer the contents of the pan to a food processor and puree. (I used a handheld stick blender right in the pan this time.)"
- "If using a food processor, return the puree to the pan. Reheat."
- "(From this point on the instructions are for both if making this from fresh yuzu, or using the yuzu tea base.) Simmer over low heat. If you&#39;re using yuzu tea base and it&#39;s a bit stiff, add 1 tablespoon of water."
- "Add all the ● ingredients. Mix with a spatula so that it doesn&#39;t burn. Heat until everything is well blended and shiny, and it&#39;s done. (The mixture will be quite soft at this stage.)"
- "The curd is rather liquid when it&#39;s freshly made, but it&#39;s still delicious. It will become thicker when it cools. Serve with chiffon cake or soufflé cheesecake."
- "It&#39;s perfect with yogurt too. Keep in the refrigerator when it has cooled, and eat it up as soon as you can."
- "This is how it looks the next day. It&#39;s thick and has a spread-like consistency. It&#39;s really rich, and has a different deep taste compared to jam."
- "Serve on toaste or baguettes. I recommend this the most."
- "The yuzu seeds can be put into alcohol (white liqueur, or a similar high alcohol base like vodka) and used as a skin freshener. If you add a lot of seeds, the liquid will become creamy and become a skin conditioner. Increase the collagen in your skin with the benefits of vitamin C."
