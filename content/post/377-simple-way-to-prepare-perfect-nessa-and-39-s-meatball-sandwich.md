- "Now slice a hoagie bun and then  using your hands, remove some of the bread interior to form a hollowed-out pocket shape. Brush the inside of the hollowed out buns with the olive oil. Divide half the grated mozzarella evenly between the hoagie buns and bake, uncovered, until the cheese is melted and buns are lightly golden, about 3 - 4 minutes."
- "Remove from the oven and ladle some of the sauce into the buns. Place 2 or 3 meatballs inside each bun and top with more sauce. Divide the remaining mozzarella cheese among the tops of the buns and sprinkle with the Parmesan. Return to the oven and bake until the cheeses are golden brown, 4 - 6 minutes."
