Pretty far out for soft ice cream for me but was worth the drive. Ice cream itself was really good plus all the high quality toppings and homemade waffle cones (probably from the same management next door, Little Tart Bakery) Waffle cone was really good that I finished the whole thing. We are producing rich and creamy soft serve ice cream premix with all the nutrition values. It comes in powder form which can be stored for long time easily.

This premix is perfect recipe of Soft serve ice cream. Available Flavours: Strawberry, Chocolate, Vanilla, Butterscotch etc. We serve ice cream cones/sugar cones/waffle cones manufactured with finest ingredients on automated cone manufacturing ovens.. and semi -refrigerated conditions. Stir in ice cream until completely combined, then transfer. Only a wafer cone will do for a proper Mister Softee scoop. (For bonus points, line the bottom of the cone with chocolate dip a la the King Cone.) As for the Mister Softee swirl, that&#39;s hard to get without some pretty specialized equipment.
