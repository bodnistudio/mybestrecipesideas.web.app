		The Homemade Apple Pie is a delectable dessert that is made from fresh apples and baked in a whole wheat pie crust.
	
		The soft texture of the apples, along with the zing of cinnamon brings out the best from this apple pie.
	
		I love this recipe for the fact that it is made from the whole wheat pie crust that came out from a quest to make it a healthy dessert.
