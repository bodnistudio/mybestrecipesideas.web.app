<h3>Steps to make Chicken pot pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			To make the filling: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Spray a large shallow casserole dish, or 6 individual casserole dishes with cooking spray. I used the disposable tin pans..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Season the chicken with 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. I also use chicken seasoning and garlic powder. In a large nonstick skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of the oil over a medium-high heat. Add the chicken to the pan and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer the chicken with its juices to a bowl..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add 2 more teaspoons of oil to the same pan and heat it over a medium-high heat. Add the onions, carrots and celery and cook until the vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the green beans, garlic and remaining salt and pepper and cook for 2 minute more. Add the milk. Stir the flour into the broth until it is completely dissolved and add to the pan. Cook, stirring, until the mixture comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 2 minutes more..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Return the chicken with its juices back to the pan. Add the peas and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Spoon the mixture into the baking dish or individual dishes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Top the filling with a biscuit. Bake until filling is bubbling and the biscuit topping is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Enjoy..
			
			
		</li>
	
</ol>

<p>
	
		To begin, dust a clean, dry work surface with flour and place the puff pastry over top.
	
		If the last chicken pot pie you ate came from a little green box in the freezer section, you&#39;ve been missing out on arguably the most classic — and most indulgent — of chicken dinners.
	
		I am neither a pot pie lover or a biscuit lover, but I had seconds on this.
	
		I did make some additions though.
	
		Chicken pot pie is easily one of the most popular recipes stateside with many different variations within the US.
