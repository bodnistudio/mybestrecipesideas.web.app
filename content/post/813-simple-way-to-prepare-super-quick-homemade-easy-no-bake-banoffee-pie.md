<h3>Instructions to make Easy No-Bake Banoffee Pie:</h3>

		<li>
			Lightly grease and line with baking parchment a 20cm/8inch springform cake pan or loose-bottom tart pan. Only line the bottom..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Make the base: whiz up the biscuits in a food processor, or bash them inside a plastic bag using a rolling pin. Do this until the biscuits are fine breadcrumbs..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the melted butter and mix well until the mixture resembles wet sand..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Press the biscuit mix into the base and up the sides of your prepared tin. Refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour until set.

			When the base has set, remove from the fridge and pour the Nestle Caramel into the base evenly. Smooth out. Slice the bananas and evenly place each slice over the caramel until it is fully covered. Place back into the fridge while you make the cream topping.

			Next, whisk the double cream until you have very soft peaks. Add the vanilla and icing sugar and beat in, until the cream becomes slightly stiffer, still keeping soft peaks. Be very careful to keep an eye on the thickness, as you donâ€™t want to over-whisk the cream!.
