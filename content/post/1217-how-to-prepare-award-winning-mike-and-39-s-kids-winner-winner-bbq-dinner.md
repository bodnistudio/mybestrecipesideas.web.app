- "Coat an oven safe dish with a slight amount of olive oil and fully coat chicken breasts with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce. Top and bottom.   Reserve some BBQ sauce for your Baked Beans and basting while grilling your chicken.  You can use your remaining sauce in your oven safe chicken bowl once baked but, fresh/uncooked sauce is more viscous and will help to char your chicken better."
- "Create / mix your baked beans."
- "Seal/cover your baked beans tightly."
- "Bake chicken covered for 40 to 45 minutes at 425°."
- "At the same time, place your baked beans in the oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes."
- "At 40 minutes - peirce your thickest piece of chicken breast in the center. If the center fluids run clear - you&#39;re good. If bleeding pink - bake up to 10 minutes longer."
- "While waiting, mix everything in the Buttered Corn section."
- "Stove top heat or microwave your corn until hot and butter is fully melted.   Mix well and seal tightly. You&#39;ll want those dried Parsley flakes to soften."
- "Create your chilly side salads.   Garnish salads as you and your guests desire.  My graduate student went with her parents favorites. Fresh chilled tomatoes, white onions, cilantro, basil, grated cheddar cheese and cucumbers."
- "My student also made homemade Ranch Dressing. 1 cup whole milk, 1 cup quality mayonnaise, a 1 oz Ranch Dressing packet, a Mason jar and 1 minute of shaking it is all it took her.   Homemade Ranch Dressing is SO much better than bottled. You wouldn&#39;t believe the difference!"
- "Pull chicken and beans from oven. Stir beans."
- "Place chicken on a hot, clean grill until fully charred.   Baste chicken with BBQ Sauce while grilling.  Know that brined meats are much harder to char on a grill. So, make sure your grill is searing hot. Trust me - you&#39;ll want some serious char on your chicken!"
- "Enjoy your taste of a very simple, Southern BBQ supper!"
