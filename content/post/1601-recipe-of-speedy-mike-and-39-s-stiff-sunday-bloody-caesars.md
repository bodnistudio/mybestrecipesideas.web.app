Stiff Little Fingers - Bloody Sunday (Letra e música para ouvir) - Take a look around you all is dead / A good look around makes me see red Of course we&#39;re right You know we&#39;re right It&#39;s worse than monday Yes of course we&#39;re right And you know we&#39;re right There&#39;s nothing to do on Bloody Sunday. The future is meaningless but the pasta is now. Drama Tv Shows are the best thing that ever happened to me. The problem is that most folks do not know how to make or even drink this drink.
