We recommend using chuck, also known as front shoulder meat, for this beef stew. The round, or rear muscle, also works well, too. While these tough cuts take time to become tender, they release collagen as they cook for a smooth, gelatin-rich broth. Note: If you see pre-cut packages labeled &#34;beef stew meat&#34; at the store, be sure to ask your butcher what type of meat is included.
