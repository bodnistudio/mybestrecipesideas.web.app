- "Place the cream, mizuame and instant coffee into a saucepan and heat it up until the mixture is just about to come to a boil but turn the heat off before the boiling point."
- "Pour the cream mixture into the bowl from Step 1 and mix everything together with a rubber spatula. Lastly, add the butter, which should be warmed to room temperature, and mix it in so that you don&#39;t fold in any air as well."
- "Pour the mixture from Step 3 into a tray lined with parchment paper or cling film and leave the mixture to chill and set in the refrigerator. Once chilled, take the truffles out, cut into your desired size, and dust with cocoa powder."
