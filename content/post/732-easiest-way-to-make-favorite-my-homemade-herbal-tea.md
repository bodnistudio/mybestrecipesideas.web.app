1. Get  small cinnamon stick, (around 5cm)
1. Take  dried cardamom grains

While there are many ways to formulate your own tea blends, I personally like to keep my herbal tea blends to no more than three herbs and then potentially compliment with additional seasonal spices for flavor if desired. My favorite tea makin&#39;s are alfalfa, lemon balm, mint (all kinds), rose hips, rosemary, and thyme, although zesty, mineral-rich teas can be brewed from almost any edible herb, wild or cultivated. Herbal tea is also said to aid digestion. It can help break down fats and speed up the emptying of the stomach, which will reduce symptoms of bloating, indigestion, and vomiting.
