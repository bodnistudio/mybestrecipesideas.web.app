Honey Crisp: The pie pictured uses ALL honey crisp apples. I don&#39;t always do this but honey crisp apples are delicious and if you&#39;re going to go with a very simple, one varietal type of pie, I say you can&#39;t lose with honey crisp. You&#39;ll put the pie plate directly on that, which helps the bottom crust turn a bit more flaky, rather than totally soggy. Zest and juice lemon and add to apples. Add Flour and Sugar and Pumpkin pie spice.
