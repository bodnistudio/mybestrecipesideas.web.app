recipeinstructions:
- "Start by setting the butter out to room temp and then adding about a tbsp of horseradish or to taste along with salt to taste and whip it, cover with plastic wrap."
- "Set your steak out to get to room temp. Brush with olive oil and season the fat side. Set your grill to medium and cook roughly 4 minutes fat side down turning 2 minutes in to cross hatch. At this time season the lean side. Pull off direct heat and finish cooking lean side down for an additional 4 minutes or until it reaches 125 to 130 and remove."

- "Don’t be worried about the rosy red color of the meat. This tender cut retains that color and tenderness so judge only by the internal temp."
