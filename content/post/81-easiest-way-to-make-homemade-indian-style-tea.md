Chai (Spiced Indian-style Tea) From Badmaash restaurant, in Los Angeles, this aromatic tea, called &#34;cutting chai&#34; in India, is served in small glasses because it&#39;s so strong (&#34;cutting&#34; is the transliteration of the Hindi word for &#34;half&#34;). Bring the water, ginger, and cinnamon to a boil. Turn the burner to medium-high heat and heat the mixture until it starts to bubble vigorously. If you are not using a teapot which is set aside only for tea making, use a clean vessel without any oil or tangy residue left on it because it might lead.
