Stir/scrape until the eggs are almost set. Add cheese; turn off the heat and let the eggs melt the cheese. Microwaved scrambled eggs lend themselves especially well to single servings, since you can eat them straight out of the bowl you cook them in and avoid doing any extra dishes, and it only takes. For silky, outrageously good scrambled eggs, cook them low and slow This method, which Mark Bittman learned from James Beard, is very low and very slow: you place the eggs over very low heat, stirring frequently, breaking up the curds as they form The results are without compare Finely ground white pepper is traditionally used in French-style scrambled eggs, omelets, and cream sauces because it blends in. Black pepper is a fine substitution.; Additional ingredients, especially ones with a lot of moisture in them like tomatoes or onions, can throw off the timing, and your eggs can come out watery.
