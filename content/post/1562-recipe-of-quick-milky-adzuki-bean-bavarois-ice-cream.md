recipeinstructions:
- "Mix powdered gelatin with water, and soak. Add milk, skim milk, and condensed milk to a pot, and heat while stirring well. Add the soaked gelatin, mix well until it all dissolves, and turn off the heat."
- "Add the boiled adzuki beans to the pot and stir, then place the mixture in your favorite mold and let it cool. Chill in the fridge to allow it to solidify. I ate it as adzuki bavarois as shown in the photo. When eating it like this, you can reduce the amount of condensed milk if you wish. It is very sweet."

- "This is a frozen version I made using heart-shaped molds. Thanks to the gelatin used in the recipe, this frozen version comes out of the mold easily and cleanly. The frozen version is great for the hot season."
