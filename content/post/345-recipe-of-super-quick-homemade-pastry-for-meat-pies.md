The pork adds a little fat so this will help to keep the pie succulent and moist. For the pastry, I have used our Lovefoodies Shortcrust Pastry recipe. This, in my opinion, is by far the best pastry to use for making this meat pie. The pastry is light and crispy, a little flaky and buttery.

Pie Crust: Mix flour and shortening. Add all the cold water at once and mix delicately. After many years of using the same never fail pie pastry recipe I decided to compare mine to another &#34;never fail pastry&#34;. It didn&#39;t occur to me until after the pastry was made that the ratio of lard and flour is wrong. I have no problems with flaky crusts especially since I am used to making flaky puff pastry, but I need the crust to be more stable.
