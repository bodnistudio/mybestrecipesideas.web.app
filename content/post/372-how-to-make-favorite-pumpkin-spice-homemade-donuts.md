<h3>Instructions to make Pumpkin spice homemade donuts:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Open biscuits cut hole in the center. To cut my hole I used an olive oil cap..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Heat canola oil on medium heat once heated add 2 to 3 donuts at a time. They cook fast so do a few at a time to prevent burning..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cook about a minute per side they should be golden brown on each side..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Have a long pan lined with foil to put donuts on. Dip each warm donut in your glaze put back on pan. I only glazed 1 side you may do both..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			For the glaze put powdered sugar in a bowl slowly add a little creamer.  Blend with fork until smooth. For a thick glaze add less cream for a thinner glaze add more cream..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Top with cinnamon or pumpkin spice seasoning and enjoy! I used cinnamon..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Don&#39;t forget to fry up those little holes you cut out they are perfect for some donut holes!.
			
			
		</li>
