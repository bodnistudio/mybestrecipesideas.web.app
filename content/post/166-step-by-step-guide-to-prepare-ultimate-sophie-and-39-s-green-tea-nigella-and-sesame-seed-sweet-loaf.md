recipeingredient:
- "275 grams self raising flour"
- "1 sachet fast acting dried yeast"
- "25 grams butter"
- "150 ml green tea lukewarm and well stewed"
- "1/2 tbsp Nigella seeds"
- "1/2 tbsp Sesame seeds"
- "30 ml milk"
- "60 grams sugar brown is best"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the flour, yeast and sugar together."
- "Chop your butter in to tiny chunks, place on top of your flour mix and pour on the lukewarm tea."
- "Squeeze the green tea bags so there is no water left and the liquid gets into the dough mix."
- "Mix into a sticky dough, and tip out onto a floured surface."
- "Knead for ten minutes, adding flour to help with the kneading as required."
