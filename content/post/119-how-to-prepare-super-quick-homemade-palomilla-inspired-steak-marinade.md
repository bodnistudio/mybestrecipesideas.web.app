recipeingredient:
- "2.5 pounds steak"
- "1 sweet onion either cut into 14strips if cooking in pan or in 12 thick disks cut horizontally for grilling"
- " For the marinade"
- "1/4 cup fresh orange juice"
- "2 Tablespoons fresh lime juice"
- "2 teaspoons kosher salt"
- "1 teaspoon grated garlic"
- "1 teaspoon oregano"
- "1/4 teaspoon cumin"
- "2 Tablespoons olive oil"
- " optional 1 teaspoon sugar if orange juice isnt that sweet"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all marinade ingredients except olive oil, stir or whisk until all salt (and optional sugar) are dissolved. Give it a taste and adjust seasoning if needed, then stir in oil."
- "Pour half the marinade over your steaks, then flip and repeat with the other half. (Or, as you might already know, Ziplocs with the air sucked out of them once you put the steak and marinade in are a great way to get the marinade to take more quickly and effectively.)  Since these were roughly 1-inch thick steaks and I was going to grill them shortly, I let them marinate on the counter for an hour before grilling, flipping a couple of times in the process."
- "Cook as desired and remember to let the steak rest for 5 to 10 minutes depending on thickness before slicing/serving.  Enjoy!"
