I mean when u r cooking it, coffee will b like homogenous with water. N after u pour it into fincan it will start to fall down n u will see it.  I dnt know if u can find fresh Turkish coffee bean. In stores it s in bean form n they grind right  before u buy it n u will feel the smell during grinding n it will be hot cause of process. Next time im buying i ll take a video for u. But u can buy it in packages as well. In migros n other big markets u can find it i guess."
