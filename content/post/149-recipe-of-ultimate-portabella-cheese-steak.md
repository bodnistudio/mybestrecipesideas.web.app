Hey everyone, it is Jim, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, portabella cheese steak. One of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Portabella Cheese Steak is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It's easy, it's fast, it tastes yummy. It's enjoyed by millions every day. They're fine and they look fantastic. Portabella Cheese Steak is something that I have loved my entire life.

Cheese steaks are a Philadelphia tradition: thin slices from a rich and very fatty slab of beef, fried up and topped with a heavy cheese sauce. We&#39;ve cut down on the fat considerably--but not on the taste. All it needs is a cold beer or a glass of pinot noir on the side.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook portabella cheese steak using 8 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Portabella Cheese Steak:

1. Get 1 Tbsp olive oil
1. Take 3 pack portabella mushroom caps
1. Make ready 1 medium yellow onion, sliced
1. Prepare 1 red bell pepper, seeded and sliced
1. Take 1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce
1. Take 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1. Prepare 4 slices provolone cheese
1. Make ready 4 brioche hamburger buns


Clean the mushrooms with a damp kitchen towel to remove any soil that clings to the mushrooms. Reduce heat to low; sprinkle the vegetables with flour and stir to coat. Stir in broth and soy sauce; bring to a simmer. It doesn&#39;t get much better than a low-carb, Philly Cheesesteak stuffed in a Portobello Mushroom!

Steak and mushrooms work so well together, so why not make stuff them with this cheesy deliciousness! I love a The secret to these cheesesteak loaded fries is that there&#39;s no steak. Portobello mushrooms packed with flavor are layered on fries with cheese sauce instead of sliced beef. Some Portobello steak recipes require soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, etc., but the problem is that mushrooms are like sponges and end up boiling instead of grilling, which gives them a chewy texture. Other recipes ask for garlic, which burns and gives a bitter taste to the mushrooms.
