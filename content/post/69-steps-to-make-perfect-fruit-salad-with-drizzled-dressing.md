This recipe uses cultured coconut milk as a substitution for buttermilk and mayonnaise in a dill-flavored, creamy salad dressing. I found an alternative to dairy-based yogurt. Cultured coconut milk is not as thick as yogurt, but it works as a sub for buttermilk and mayonnaise in a traditional ranch-style salad dressing or dip. In a large bowl, toss together the strawberries, cantaloupe, pineapple, honeydew melon, blueberries, grapes and pomegranate arils. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the honey, lime zest and lime juice.
