They are a great quick lunch and really good. Back to Nature has several types of crackers that work well for this recipe but my favorite is the Stoneground Wheat. You can use a bento box system to keep the ingredients separated so they can build their own pizzas. These homemade pizza bites are still delicious and soft, but the texture and filling are so.much.better than the store-bought snacks. Place each pizza dough triangle into each mini muffin cup, leaving the two ends of the triangle sticking out (these will help you pull out the pizza bites easier after baking).
