My philosophy of healing is to let the right. Simon asked &#39;Older Sienna&#39; and Tanna, &#39;Do you two like spaghetti Carbonara?&#39; The majority of chefs agree that &#34;true&#34; carbonara has guanciale and not bacon or pancetta, although both make fine substitutions. The key to good spaghetti alla carbonara, like any good piece of cooking (and especially this one), is the quality of the ingredients. Esta receta nace de la fusión entre la típica carbonara con nata y nuestra salsa al curry suave consiguiendo una receta de distinta, con un sabor delicado y que os prometo que os sorprenderá. Anímaros a probarla y ya sabéis …. a la cocina!!
