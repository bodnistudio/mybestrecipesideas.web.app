Having a large bowl of it in the fridge takes the guesswork out of what to have with what we will be grilling. Hope you enjoy this Seafood Pasta Salad as much as we do. I love the flavors in this pasta salad with the addition of the lemon, shrimp and Old Bay Seasoning! I often substitute whole wheat pasta in this dish. I also double the mayonnaise, Old Bay seasoning and lemon, adding half when I initially make it, then just before serving I add some more, so it isn&#39;t dry after sitting in the fridge for flavors to meld.
