<h3>Steps to make Amazing aubergine and halloumi pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Cut thinly the aubergines lengthwise and place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Drizzle with a bit of olive oil and bake for 15 minutes or until soft. Let them cool..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Meanwhile, grate the halloumi cheese and cheddar and cut the ham in long strips..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Prepare the yogurt sauce by placing all the ingredients in a bowl and mixing well. I would advise you not to use a lot of salt as both the cheeses used are salty..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Oil the baking tray that you will use (either a long pyrex type or a round tin with a removable bottom will do) and start placing the filo sheets. Each one you add needs to be oiled. Place six sheets for the bottom and then start placing the aubergines.Season with salt and pepper..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			On top of the aubergines, add half of the grated cheeses and all of the smoked ham and season with some oregano. Cover with another filo sheet and pour a bit of the yogurt sauce..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			To create the second layer of the pie, add the remaining aubergines and grated cheeses, season with salt, pepper and oregano and cover the pie with the remaining filo sheets, oiling them as you go along..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pre heat the oven at 190Â°C.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pour the rest of the yogurt sauce on top of the pie, covering it all..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake minimum for one hour or until the bottom and top of the pie is nicely golden..
