Fresh pasta was ideal for rolling up the manicotti tubes in our Baked Manicotti with Meat Sauce, but no-boil lasagna noodles worked almost as well with a fraction of the effort. Breaking down the meat in the food processor allowed its flavo. Pour a layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a baking dish, using half of what you have. Using a spoon or piping bag, fill the noodles with the cheese mixture and place on top of sauce. A pleasing blend of ground beef, cottage cheese, mozzarella, Parmesan, egg whites and dried oregano is stuffed into large tubes of cooked manicotti in this satisfying baked dish.
