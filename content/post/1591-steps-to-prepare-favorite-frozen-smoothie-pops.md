These frozen smoothie pops are definitely something they can handle. For the ones you see here, we started with a simple homemade granola using Quaker&#39;s Old Fashion Oats and gave it a few mix-ins, baked and cooled it, then layered it throughout the smoothie pops. The granola softens to the consistency of an oatmeal cookie. Obviously, we love smoothies, but sometimes — whether it&#39;s super hot outside or you&#39;re just not into sipping things through a straw — a person wants something with all the nutrients of a green smoothie, but that isn&#39;t actually a green smoothie.
