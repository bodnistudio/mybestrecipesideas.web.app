Frying is a dry heat cooking method, which can b used on city hams, country ham, and ham slices. Frying ham works on the principle of using hot oil to cook the meat, producing a serving of ham with a crispy brown outside and juicy, flavorful meat inside. If you want to apply a glaze to your ham steak, brush the glaze over the surface of the meat as you cook it, flipping the steak until the glaze thickens or is cooked through. You don&#39;t have to condemn sliced ham to a cold, dry sandwich. Frying sliced ham helps crisp up the meat and makes it enticingly hot -- perfect to go inside doughy rolls, on top of a stack of waffles or anywhere you might usually include bacon.
