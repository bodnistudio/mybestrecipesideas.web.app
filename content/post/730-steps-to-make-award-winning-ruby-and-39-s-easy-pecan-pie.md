I am a Mom to a blended Korean / Mexican American family that loves to share what I cook in my home. Most pecan pie recipes I&#39;ve found call for two cups of sugar—one cup of corn syrup plus one cup of either granulated or brown sugar. I find that just a bit too sweet for my taste, so for this pecan pie recipe, I&#39;ve dropped the sugar down by half a cup. Feel free to reduce further or add more to your taste.
