- "1 lb ground beef"
- "2 packages brown gravy mix"
- "1 large potato"
- "1 packages deep dish frozen pie crust"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350° F"
- "Remove frozen pie shells from freezer, open pack and separate the two shells to allow to thaw while preparing the ingredients."
- "In a large skillet, brown the ground beef (or whatever ground meat you prefer) until well cooked and browned."
- "While the meat is cooking, wash off the potato, prick with a fork on both sides, and cook in microwave on high for about 2-3 minutes. Flip the potato over and cook another 2-3 minutes until it is spongy to the touch. Cook longer if necessary. Let sit."
- "Cook the gravy according to directions. Most call for 1 cup cold water in a saucepan adding the powdered gravy while whisking on medium heat until it begins to boil then turn heat to low and cook for one minute until thickened...stirring to keep from clumping."
- "In a large bowl combine all the ingredients (meat, potato and gravy) and stir until thoroughly mixed."
- "Pour into the pie shell. Take other pie shell and place over the filled pie and work it lose from its tin. Press the edges together (flute) then cut slits in the top."
- "Place on a cookie sheet to keep possible drippings contained and bake for 20 to 30 minutes (more or less depending on your ovens temperature) checking often after 20 minutes until lightly browned."
- "I usually double the recipe these days because it goes so fast. Obviously, you can add all sorts of things to it...I&#39;ve added French fried onions and mushrooms sauteed in butter which my husband loved but honestly my favorite is just the original.lol"
