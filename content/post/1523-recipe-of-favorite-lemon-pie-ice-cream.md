Use a wooden or rubber spatula to stir constantly, and make sure to scrape along the bottom of the pan. Be careful of over cooking.  The mixture is ready when it has a custard-like consistency and coats the spatula."
- "Prepare an ice bath with a large bowl inside it, containing the remainder of the heavy cream. Pour the egg yolk and milk mixture into the bowl with the heavy cream. Keep mixing until the mixture has cooled. Pulverize the graham crackers and add them to mixture at this point. Whisk well together."
- "If the mixture is chilled you can run it through an ice cream maker,  if it is not chilled,  put the mixture in the fridge for a couple of hours before proceeding with the ice cream maker. Follow the manufacturer&#39;s direction to prepare the ice cream. in the last five minutes add the lemon Curd. After finish,  remove the ice cream from the ice cream maker with a spatula and place it in an airtight container and this in the freezer for at least two hours."
- "OPTIONAL: if you don&#39;t have an ice cream maker you can make the ice cream by hand. After step 9 pour the mixture in a airtight container and this in the freezer. Every 30 minutes remove the container from the freezer and whisk the mixture thoroughly (this is to avoid ice crystals).  Keep doing this every half an hour for the next 4 hours. In the second to last whisk, add the lemon Curd."
