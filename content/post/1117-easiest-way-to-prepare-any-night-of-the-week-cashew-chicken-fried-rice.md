##### The ingredients needed to make Cashew Chicken Fried Rice:

1. Take  boneless skinless chicken breasts, cubed

But making the sauce just for a single or two servings fried rice is difficult since the recipe needs only few red chilies and they don&#39;t really get blended well.

You&#39;ll love how saucy this is, and how you can As with all my stir fries, this Cashew Chicken comes with plenty of sauce. There&#39;s nothing sadder than when you&#39;re left with a bowl of plain white rice with no sauce to eat it with. After a few days struggling with getting everything moved over to WordPress, I&#39;m on my way to a nifty new self-hosted That&#39;s why, a few times a year, I take it out of it&#39;s awkward cabinet, lovingly wipe the layer of dust off and whip up a batch of fried rice.
