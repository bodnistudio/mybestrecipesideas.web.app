recipeingredient:
- "2 gou 360ml or 300g Short grain rice turn into approx 15 lb Sushi Rice"
- "3-4 tbsps Rice vinegar or White wine vinegar"
- "2 tbsps Sugar"
- "1 teaspoon Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the rice into a bowl and pour cold water. Shape your hand like holing a tennis ball then rinse the rice drawing circles gently but quickly 10 times. Dispose the water. Repeat 4-5 times until the water gets semitransparent. Drain with the strainer."
- "A tip: Some decades ago, they said you had to wash or scrub the rice to remove the smell. But because of development of rice-milling technology today, it&#39;s recommended to rinse it gently. If not, grains are likely to chip and run gooey after steam. Rice for Sushi must be cooked slightly harder than normal steamed rice."
- "Put rinsed rice into the rice cooker and pour 400ml water. Or follow the scale inside if yours has it. Cook as usual, or if there&#39;s a menu for Sushi rice, you might be able to try to use it I haven&#39;t use this function ever though:)"
- "When the rice is done, swiftly add sugar, vinegar and salt on the rice and mix well. Not to crush the individual grains while mixing. Spread the seasoned rice onto a plate to cool down. If possible please fan to cook faster, so that the sushi rice gets shining."
- "Just for your reference... the dinner of the day. Futo-maki sushi with this rice, Chilled tofu, Simmered squash with minced pork, Pea-tip salad."
