- "2/3 cup honey"
- "1/2 cup apple cider vinegar"
- "4 chicken breast halves boneless and skinless"
- "2 tbsp unsalted butter"
- "1 handful fresh thyme sprigs plus a few delicate leaves"

Add the vinegar and let simmer, swirling the pot occasionally, until reduced by half. This&#39;ll be another 5 to 10 minutes.

Flip the chicken over and add the butter, thyme sprigs and garlic to the pan. Fry for another 6 to 8 minutes. As the butter melts, spoon it over the chicken. When cooked, remove the chicken to a plate to rest for 5 minutes."
- "Serve the chicken with a generous drizzle of the gastrique and a sprinkle of the delicate thyme leaves."
