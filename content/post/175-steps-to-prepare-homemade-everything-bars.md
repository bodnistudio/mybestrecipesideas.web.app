This is really an outstanding tooth bar. I have used both the &#39;standard&#39; type tooth bar with individual tips/pointy ends and now this thing. There is really no comparison, this is by far a better choice. The wicked bar digs better than the standard bar in everything I have tried so far. Any time is the perfect time to indulge in these ooey-gooey, salty-sweet peanut butter bars.
