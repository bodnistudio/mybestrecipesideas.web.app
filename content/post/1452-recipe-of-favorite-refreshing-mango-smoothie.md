Mango is on sale here this week so I bought quite a bit and we&#39;re in danger of losing them. I used buttermilk (use or lose kind of situation--I tried buttermilk in another smoothie recipe and we really liked it--you should try it too!) and chunked frozen bananas instead of ice cubes instead of ice for added thickness and fruit. Spice up your morning by adding jalapeno pepper to your green smoothie for a refreshing on-the-go breakfast.
