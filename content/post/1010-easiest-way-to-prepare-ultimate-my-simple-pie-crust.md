<h3>Steps to make My Simple Pie Crust:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Sift together the bread flour and cake flour. Cut the butter into 2 cm cubes and keep chilled..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add butter to the sifted flour, and using a dough scraper, cut the butter while mixing into the flour, until the butter forms bean-sized lumps..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add chilled water to the dough from Step 2, mix with a spatula, then use your hands to bring it together. The key is not to knead it, leaving the dots of butter intact..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Form the dough into a 10 cm x 15 cm rectangle,  wrap in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour or more in the refrigerator. When baking pies, it&#39;s easier if you prepare the dough a day in advance..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Dust your working surface with flour, then roll out the dough to 1 cm thick, then fold into thirds, bringing the sides into the center..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Rotate the dough 90º, then repeat Step 5, 5 times--making a total of six repeated rolling steps..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Now, it&#39;s ready to use! The once crumbly dough is now nice and smooth..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			To make puff pastry If you roll out the dough to 5 mm thick, then freeze them, you&#39;ll have a nice stock of puff pastry!.
			
			
		</li>
