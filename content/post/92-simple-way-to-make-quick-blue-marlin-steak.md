recipeingredient:
- "1 k blue marlin or 3 whole pieces"
- "1 lemon"
- "3 Tbsp soy sauce"
- "Dash Knorr seasoning"
- "1/4 bar butter"
- "1/2 head garlic minced"
- "1 stalk green onions"
- " Cooking oil"

recipeinstructions:
- "Clean the fish and salt (&amp; pepper to taste) it. Squeeze a good amount of lemon on each side, no need to finish the whole lemon- unless you want the taste lemony."
- "Lightly massage 1Tbsp soy sauce on each marlin piece, both sides. Few drops of Knorr seasoning on each side. Slice in half like in the picture. Gently remove any bones if there are any. Then let it rest in the marinade."
- "Heat 2Tbsp oil, add a slice of butter. Add the fish, few at a time. Ensure the oil is not too much, fish should not be submerged in oil."
- "Add a slice of butter on top while cooking the fish. When it melts, flip immediately on the other side. Do not over cook, as it will dry out the fish. Try lightly poking with a pointed end of a knife or a fork- no resistance means it&#39;s cooked. Or remove from oil after a few minutes. It will continue cooking on the plate anyway. Cook the rest of the pieces in the same way."
- "Prepare the garnish- Brown the mince garlic in oil. Chop the green onions. Sprinkle on top of the fish and serve. Enjoy!"
