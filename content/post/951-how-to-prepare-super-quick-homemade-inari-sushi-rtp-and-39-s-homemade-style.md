recipeingredient:
- "5 pieces Aburaage"
- "300 ml Boiling water to remove excess oil from aburaage"
- "150 ml  Water"
- "2 tbsp  Sugar"
- "2 tbsp  Sake"
- "3 tbsp  Soy sauce"
- "2 tbsp  Mirin"
- " Basic sushi rice"
- "600 grams Plain cooked rice"
- "2 tbsp  Vinegar"
- "2 tbsp  Sugar"
- "1/2 tsp  Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the aburaage in half, then quickly boil both sides for about 30 seconds each. It&#39;s quicker if you boil three at a time instead of boiling them all at once."
- "Place them on a flat plate, then lightly squeeze out the excess water with chopsticks. Put the ☆ ingredients in a pot, then when it boils, add the aburaage and spread them out flat."
- "Reduce to low heat, cover with a drop lid and then the pot lid, then simmer. After 5 minutes, turn off the heat and let sit. Once they cool, they&#39;re ready. Lightly squeeze out the excess liquid, then stuff with rice."
- "Put piping hot rice in a large dish or bowl, then sprinkle in the combined ★ ingredients, mixing with diagonal cutting motions."
- "Once the rice cools to the touch, stuff the aburaage. If it tears and creates a hole, cut out nori seaweed and set it over the hole from the inside to repair."
- "For 3 year olds, make hosomaki narrow rolls. If you cut them not vertically, but horizontally in half, they become much easier to eat, and easy to get the child to eat."
- "You can also vary the rice. Mix rice with golden sesame seeds or use hijiki rice, rice with takana pickles, or mixed rice. Or even rice with cheese (for children)."
- "I also made some tsukudani with wrung-out bonito dashi and kombu seaweed with jako fish and ground sesame seeds. Rice mixed with this has the aroma and flavor of bonito and is a great hit."
