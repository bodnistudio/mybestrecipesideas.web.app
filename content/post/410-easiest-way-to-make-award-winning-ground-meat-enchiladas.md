Hello everybody, it's Brad, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we're going to make a special dish, ground meat enchiladas. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Ground meat enchiladas is one of the most favored of current trending foods in the world. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It is simple, it's fast, it tastes yummy. Ground meat enchiladas is something that I've loved my entire life. They're fine and they look fantastic.

I usually make chicken or seafood enchiladas with a green or red sauce and I thought the ground beef would be a nice change. Place enchiladas seam side down in the baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce over the top, making sure that tortillas are completely covered.


To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook ground meat enchiladas using 13 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

Instead of using taco seasoning to flavor the meat, like I do here, my mom would mix a package of cream cheese and an egg in with the cooked ground beef and onion and just pour a can of red enchilada sauce over them.

Serve them along with some Mexican rice, everyone will come back for seconds. Ground beef enchiladas are quick and easy but don&#39;t be afraid to experiment with shredded pork or leftover baked chicken breasts!
