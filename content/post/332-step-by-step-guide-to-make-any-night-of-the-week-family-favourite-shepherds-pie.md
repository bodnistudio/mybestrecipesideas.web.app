recipeinstructions:

- "Add the beef mince and cook for 5 minutes or so until browned. Now add the Quorn mince and cook for a few minutes."
- "Sprinkle over the Oxo cube and paprika and stir into the mince. Add the balsamic vinegar and stir again. Add a few tbsps of stock and cook for a minute or two to allow the mince to absorb the flavour."

- "Season the mixture with salt and pepper and take off the heat. If you have time, let the mince mixture and the mash cool a little as it&#39;s easier to build the pie when its had time to cool down."
- "When ready, pour the mince mix into a large ovenproof dish. Spoon the mashed potato on the top and fluff up with a fork."
- "Cook in a preheated oven at 190˚ for about 25-35 minutes. (If you have left the mixture to cool completely beforehand, reduce the heat of the oven to 180˚ and cook for 40 - 45 minutes.)"
- "Serve with some fresh green veg whilst piping hot. Try not to fall out over the crispy bits!"
