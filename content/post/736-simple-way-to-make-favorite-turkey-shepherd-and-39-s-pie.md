<h3>Steps to make Turkey Shepherd&#39;s Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Cut up meat into small pieces. I don&#39;t shred it but as small as I can..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Mix into a bowl, or straight into your cooking dish, with your vegetables..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Hopefully you have some leftover gravy...if not just make more :-). Add some to the meat and vegetable mix...just enough to make it moist..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			If you were doing this all in a separate bowl, now place the meat, vegetables, gravy mixture to your cooking dish and flatten. Place stuffing over the top and flatten. Ladel a little bit of gravy over stuffing again just to moisten..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add mashed potatoes to the top and distribute evenly. Much easier to do this if the potatoes are warm. Take a fork and run it flatly over the potatoes so you get small little peaks all over.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In the oven she goes. 350 - 375 â„‰ for about 35 - 40 min. You&#39;ll start seeing the peaks get brown. Then broil for 3 min (watch it doesn&#39;t burn).
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Let it cool for a few minutes and then serve with gravy to your liking. Every bite is heaven!.
			
			
		</li>
