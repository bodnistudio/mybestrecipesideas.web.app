- "For the snowmen I cut out different colour hat shapes and rolled little balls of orange icing into cones for the noses"
- "These will work well for shapes like xmas trees, stars etc. They make a nice treat for the kids stockings. Put a small cellophane bag over the top and tie with a metallic twist tie"
