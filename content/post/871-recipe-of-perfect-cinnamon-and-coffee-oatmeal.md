Lately I have been experimenting with protein fortified baked oatmeal because delicious prep ahead breakfast that hold well are hard to come by. Swap out buttermilk for the milk and vinegar. Mixing milk and vinegar together creates a homemade buttermilk that is obviously not needed if you use the real deal. The flavor in my cinnamon coffee cookies comes from instant coffee crystals and of course, cinnamon! The instant coffee crystals don&#39;t give the cookies an overpowering flavor at all.
