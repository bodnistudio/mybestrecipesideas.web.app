Preserved lemon is a traditional North African condiment where its sour and salty flavor is adds a distinct flavor to classic tagines, roast chickens and other meals. Moroccan flavors of saffron, preserved lemon, and cumin seed infuse slow-braised chicken thighs, traditionally served with couscous or rice. My first foray into Moroccan cuisine. I cooked it in a tagine and it turned out beautifully.
