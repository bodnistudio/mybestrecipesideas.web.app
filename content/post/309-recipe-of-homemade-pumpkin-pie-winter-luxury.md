recipeingredient:
- "1 Sugar Pumpkin"
- "1 cup Sugar"
- "1.5 teaspoon Cinnamon"
- "1 teaspoon Ground Cloves"
- "1 teaspoon Ground Allspice"
- "1/2 teaspoon Ground Ginger"
- "1/2 teaspoon Vanilla Extract"
- "1/2 teaspoon Salt"
- "4 Eggs"
- "3 cup Pumpkin Glop"
- "1.5 cans (12 oz) Sweetened Condensed Milk"
- "1 teaspoon Pumpkin Spice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Yield: One 9-inch deep dish pie or two 8-inch shallow pies. Preheat oven to 350 degrees."
- "Wash the exterior of the pumpkin in cool or warm water, no soap."
- "Cut the pumpkin in half. A serrated knife and a sawing motion works best - a smooth knife is more likely to slip."
- "Scrape the insides. You want to get out that stringy, dangly stuff that coats the inside surface. Note: can save seeds to cook separately."
- "Place it cut side down into a covered oven container. Fill container with 3/4&#34; water. Cover the ovenproof container (with a lid), and pop it in a 350 F (165 C) oven.   It normally takes about 45 minutes to 90 minutes (it can vary a lot!); just test it periodically by sticking it with a fork to see if it is soft!"
- "Scoop out the cooked pumpkin."
- "Puree the pumpkin.  To get a nice, smooth consistency, I use a Pillsbury hand blender. By blending it, you give the pie a smooth, satiny texture; rather than the rough graininess that is typical of cooked squashes.  Note: You may freeze the puree or pie filling to use it later! Just use a freezer bag or other container to exclude as much air as possible. It should last a year or more in a deep freezer."
- "Mix in all ingredients. Make the pie crust (I use Pillsbury)  It is also time to start preheating the oven. Turn it on and set it to 425 F."
- "Bake at 425 F for the first 15 minutes, then turn the temperature down to 350 F and bake another 45 to 60 minutes, until a clean knife inserted into the center comes out clean."
