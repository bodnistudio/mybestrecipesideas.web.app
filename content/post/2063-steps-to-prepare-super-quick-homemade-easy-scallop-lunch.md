Seared scallops are so easy and pair so well with the crispy, buttery flavor of the bacon and fresh navel oranges. As the scallops sear in the bacon drippings, they become crisp on the outside and cook slowly on the inside.. This scallop and spaghetti dinner with a creamy sauce is fast and easy. I cook the scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that&#39;s gives the dish more flavor and they&#39;re still tender and moist.
