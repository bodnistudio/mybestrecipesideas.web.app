I&#39;ve seen this dip served with all kinda stuff; celery sticks, tortilla chips, mini bagel bites; but trust me, serving this pizza dip on toasted garlic baguettes is a must and you&#39;ll thank me once you taste it. They are a match made in heaven, nuff said. Just like pizza, this dip is best-served piping hot for all that stringy cheese action.

Try alternative versions like Hawaiian (pineapple and ham) or BBQ Chicken and Bacon.
