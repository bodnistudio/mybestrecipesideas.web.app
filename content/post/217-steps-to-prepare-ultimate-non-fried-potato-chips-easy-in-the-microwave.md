recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the potatoes and the sweet potato well, slice them using a mandolin into 1-2 mm thick slices."

- "If you over-cook them, they will burn as shown in the photo."
- "This time, it took 2 minutes × 2 times at 600 W to cook in my microwave. The cooking time will differ about 1 minute each time I make them, depending on the thickness or the moisture content of the potatoes, so please adjust accordingly."
