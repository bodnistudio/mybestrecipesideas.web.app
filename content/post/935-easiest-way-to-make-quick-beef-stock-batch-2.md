OMG it was so good and now I&#39;m planning to make another batch of broth. The only thing I would suggest is when straining the beef stock, remove the bones and squeeze the leftover content in the cheesecloth to get out all the good flavour from the vegetables and beef chunks. The broth was good prior to this but it was so much better with this. The best thing about beef stock, also known as brown stock, is its high gelatinization content which makes for a rich, flavorful stock that cannot be matched by any other stock. It is my favorite and the most highly sought stock because the sauces that you can make from a beef stock is unmatched.
