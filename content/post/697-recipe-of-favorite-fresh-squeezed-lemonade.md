- "1 2/3 cups lemon juice about 6 large lemons"
- "1 1/2 cups granulated sugar"
- "7 cups water"
- "2 cups ice cubes"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a small sauce pan bring 1 cup of water to a slow boil. Stir in sugar and continue to boil until sugar is completely dissolved, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to a simmer if necessary. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. This is your &#34;syrup&#34;."
- "While syrup is cooling &#34;squeeze&#34; your lemons. Cut each lemon in half. Use whatever juicer gadget you have to get as much juice as possible out of those suckers. Strain juice through a mesh sieve to remove seeds and pulp. If you like the pulp you can always pick out the seeds as your juicing, but we&#39;re not pulp fans."
- "Pour lemon juice into a 2 quart pitcher. Add 6 cups of cold water and 2 cups of ice. Pour in syrup until you reach your desired sweetnes. The amount needed can vary depending on the lemons. We only used about 3/4 cup of syrup for this batch."
