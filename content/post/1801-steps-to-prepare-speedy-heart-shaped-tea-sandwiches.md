recipeinstructions:
- "For the beet-mayo filling: Finely chop or grate the vegetables or use a food processor (makes it easier and quick)."
- "Transfer the chopped vegetables to a bowl. Add green onions and mix well."
- "Stir in 2 to 3 tablespoons mayonnaise, black pepper powder and red chilli flakes (depending upon how spicy you want your sandwich) and mix well. Do a taste test and adjust the spices and salt accordingly. The mayo I used was slightly sweet (the way I like it!); you can add some sugar if you want."
- "I had two sizes of heart-shaped cutters, so I used the bigger one for the beet-mayo sandwich and the smaller one for Nutella and jam-filled sandwiches. Take one slice of bread and place the cutters over them to get 2 heart shaped bread slices. If you have bigger cutters, make one heart-shaped slice for each slice of bread. Mine were smaller, so I got two heart-shaped slices, one big and one small."
- "Continue with the other slices to make more heart-shaped slices; (the leftover bread can be used to make breadcrumbs). Butter all the 12 larger heart-shaped bread slices for beet-mayo sandwiches on one side."
- "Gently place a small teaspoon of beet-mayo filling over half of the larger slices (about 6) and spread it evenly with a palette knife."
- "Place the other 6 slices (with just butter) with the butter side down on top of this and press lightly. Dainty beet-mayo tea sandwiches are ready. Now to make the Nutella and jam sandwiches. Over 3 of the smaller slices apply and spread Nutella gently. Place the other half over the top and press gently. Nutella sandwiches are ready. Similarly, make the jam sandwiches."
- "Serve these delightful, dainty and pretty heart-shaped sandwiches to your Valentine or any loved one as a snack with evening chai/coffee or as a starter or appetizer at any party. They stay good in your kids’ lunch box too, especially the jam and Nutella hearts!!! #Mealfortwo."
