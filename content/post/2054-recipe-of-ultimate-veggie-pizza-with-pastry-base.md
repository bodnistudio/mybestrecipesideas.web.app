recipeinstructions:
- "Start by warming up your oven on fan mode, 200 C."
- "Prepare your tray. If you have non-stick baking &amp; greaseproof paper then cut the paper to fit the tray. Otherwise just sprinkle a bit of oil on the tray, then flour. This will stop the pizza from sticking to the tray."
- "Next, start chopping the vegetables. You can be as creative as you want or just put everything you have in your pantry on there. I love the flavorful onion combined with the light zucchini, juicy tomatoes, and the filling mushrooms."
- "Now that everything is chopped, and our tray is ready, place the puff pastry sheet on the tray and let’s start assembling the pizza. Coat the puff pastry with the tomato paste, and allow space for the crust to form."
- "Now have fun with your toppings, you can arrange them however you want but don’t forget to distribute them evenly."
- "Lastly, use your condiments. Sprinkle a bit of salt (I love the taste of Himalayan pink salt), some crushed chillies, and thyme. Thyme brings the dish all together and makes it very tasty."
- "Place the tray in the oven and leave for 20 mins. Quick and easy! You’ll know it is done when the puff pastry crust is all golden and fluffy."
- "Serve and enjoy!"
