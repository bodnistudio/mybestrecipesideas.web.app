		</li>

			Shape the dough into the tin that you are going to use and pierce its it several times with a fork so that it doesn&#39;t expand too much in the oven. If you have any pie weights please use them at this stage of the recipe..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake the pie crust in an oven preheated to 200ÂºC for 10-13 minutes. When it&#39;s cooked to how you want it, remove the pie crust from the oven and leave it to cool..
