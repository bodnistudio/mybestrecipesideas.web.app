Delicious chocolate sponge cake layers soaked in coffee and covered with what is probably the best buttercream frosting that I have ever made, an AMAZING coffee caramel buttercream frosting! Before I started this blog an year ago, I had a place on the Internet where I documented things I cooked and baked, but never really shared recipes, just. The cake is moist and light, the coffee mousse is fantastic and the buttercream is rich and chocolatey (but definitely buy a good quality milk chocolate to keep the end product from being too. These step-by-step photos show round cakes, but you can freeze square, rectangle, bundt cakes, etc. From one baker to another- this is the best product for wrapping cakes.
