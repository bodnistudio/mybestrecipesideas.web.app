Better known as &#34;potstickers&#34; in the US, they&#39;re delightful little dumplings made with garlicky meat and vegetables, wrapped in a thin noodle-like wrapper with pleated edges. I made revisions as suggested in the recipe description to make these non-vegetarian (replaced part of the mushroom portion with surimi and ham). Takes quite a bit of time, as gyoza typically do.
