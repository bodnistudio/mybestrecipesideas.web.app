- "Add sesame oil to your frying pan and heat well. Add your purple onions and jalapeños to the pan and fry for 3 minutes. You can add additional vegetables to this dish.

- "Add your cooked noodles to the pan with your remaining broth and heat for 1 minute longer. Again, keep watching that cabbage."
- "Top with sesame seeds and serve with additional Soy and Sweet Chile Sauce with lime wedges to the side.   A great serving tip is to place some Siracha Garlic Chile Sauce in a Chinese soup spoon and rest it upon the top of your guests noodle dish.   Pot Stickers and Egg Rolls go great with this spicy noodle dish as well - although sides aren&#39;t necessarily required."
