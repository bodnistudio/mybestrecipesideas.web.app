I&#39;m not a vegan (but I don&#39;t eat much meat) and I didn&#39;t believe that a vegan meat sauce can be so mind blowing tasty - and it&#39;s totally without any soy products! I totally recommend it, this is a must try! I think it&#39;ll become a staple for us ðŸ˜‰ Thanks so much for sharing â˜… â˜… â˜… â˜… â˜… There&#39;s nothing more comforting than a warm bowl of meaty, cheesy pasta. This version is just as meaty as its beef-based counterpart, but uses vegetarian ground &#34;beef&#34; in place of the animal protein. We mixed in fresh spinach for added veggie goodness, and portobello mushrooms for a next-level umami flavor and meaty texture.
