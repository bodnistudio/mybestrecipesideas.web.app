- "Pour the liquid from the pan over meat &amp; veggies. Fill the rest with beef broth &amp; water. Cook high 6hrs or low 8hrs. The gravy might not be thick enough in the beginning but the starch from potatos &amp; the flour from the meat will thicken things up but if it needs to be thicker towards the end add some roux. Add a little at a time. It will thicken as the roux cooks &amp; be careful not to change the flavors."
