It&#39;s the perfect recipe to try if you&#39;re making beef jerky for the first time. While I prefer to dehydrate my beef jerky on my smoker, I&#39;ve included adaptations in this recipe so you can make it in an oven or classic dehydrator as well. Slowly-marinated beef strips dry into savory pieces of peppery beef jerky in a food dehydrator. Close the bag, using your fingers, work the marinade around all of the meat pieces, carefully, making sure each piece is thoroughly coated in marinade. The longer you marinade, the stronger the flavor!
