Hello everybody, it's John, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we're going to prepare a distinctive dish, kombucha base(hotel). It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Kombucha base(hotel) is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods in the world. It's easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. It is appreciated by millions daily. They are fine and they look fantastic. Kombucha base(hotel) is something which I've loved my whole life.

Replace the Kombucha regularly with a fresh batch. The finished Kombucha can be poured off and consumed, or discarded. Please note that Kombucha stored in a hotel (with numerous SCOBYs) ferments more quickly than normal and is much more potent.

##### The ingredients needed to make Kombucha base(hotel):

1. Get  quite strong tea
1. Take  water
1. Prepare  Scoby, if you don&#39;t have it, use 1/3 bottle of Konbucha original (not flavoured)
1. Take  some more water, if needed
1. Prepare  sugar


Once your kombucha is finished fermenting, it is time to bottle it and store it in the refrigerator. You can use a siphon or pour through a funnel, but make sure to leave around a cup of kombucha in the jar to use to get your next batch started. I then store the developed child in the hotel to be used when the mother is no longer functioning (or to give to friends. I continue to separate the child from mother until I want to try an experiment brew, or the quality of kombucha begins to decrease.
