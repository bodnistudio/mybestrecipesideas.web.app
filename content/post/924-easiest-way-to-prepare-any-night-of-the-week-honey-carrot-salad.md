Hey everyone, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, honey carrot salad. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Honey Carrot Salad is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It's simple, it's fast, it tastes yummy. It is appreciated by millions daily. Honey Carrot Salad is something that I've loved my whole life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

A traditional grated French Carrot Salad is dressed more simply with just lemon juice and olive oil. It&#39;s fresh and light, intended to cut through rich French food. This Honey Dijon Mustard dressed version has more flavour - so much so that I&#39;ve had it as a light meal on more than one occasion.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have honey carrot salad using 7 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Honey Carrot Salad:

1. Prepare 1/2 cup raisins
1. Take 1 cup diced cucumber seeds removed
1. Make ready 1 cup walnut halves
1. Take 4 tablespoons honey divided
1. Make ready Pinch salt
1. Get 1/3-1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon


In a large bowl, mix together the carrots, pineapple and raisins. Stir in the honey, mayonnaise and lemon juice until evenly coated. This Honey Citrus Carrot salad is my take on the fresh German version, which can be eaten as a light cold side dish or can be used as a salad topping itself (it&#39;s like Inception for salads). Super easy to make with the right tools (see below), it&#39;s ready in only ten minutes and keeps well as a make-ahead dish to nibble on throughout the week.
