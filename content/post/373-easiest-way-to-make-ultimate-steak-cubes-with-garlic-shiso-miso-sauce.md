recipeingredient:
- "220 to 230 grams Pork chicken beef etc meat thats cut thickly  I used pork roast this time"
- "2 tsp Katakuriko potato starch flour"
- "2 tsp Miso"
- "2 tsp Mirin"
- "1 tsp Cooking sake"
- "1/2 to 1 teaspoon Sugar"
- "1/2 tsp Soy sauce"
- "3 leaves Shiso leaves"
- "2 to 3 cloves Garlic"
- "1 Salt pepper black pepper"
- "1 Vegetable oil"
- "1 Red chili pepper optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the ◆ ingredients. Grate just 1/2 of a clove of garlic, add to the ◆ ingredients and mix. Take the cores out of the remaining garlic cloves and slice about 1 mm thick."
- "Finely shred the shiso leaves."
- "Cut the meat into easy-to-eat cubes (I used pork roast meat in the photo). Season with salt and pepper, and coat evenly with the katakuriko."
- "Put the sliced garlic and oil in a frying pan and cook until the garlic is fragrant. (If you want the dish to be spicy, add a de-seeded red chili pepper at this time.)"
- "The garlic will burn in no time so keep an eye on it. When it is lightly brown, place the garlic out onto a paper towel. (Leave the oil in the frying pan.)"
- "Pan fry the meat in the same frying pan. Don&#39;t move it around until it has browned. When the first side has browned nicely..."
- "...brown the other side too. If you are using pork or chicken, it should be cooked through to the center, so add 1 tablespoon of sake (not listed in the ingredients), lower the heat, cover with a lid and cook through."
- "Take the lid off. If there&#39;s any moisture left in the pan the flavor will not be as strong and the sauce won&#39;t coat the meat properly, so turn the heat up to evaporate that moisture. Add the ◆ ingredients to the pan and mix quickly. Turn off the heat."
- "Add the shiso leaves, mix them up a little and it&#39;s done. (The shiso leaves will soften in the residual heat.) Arrange on serving plates and sprinkle with black pepper."
- "This sauce transforms even the blandest cuts of chicken into a flavor-packed meal. Here I used 230 g of breast meat after taking the skin off (1 breast)."
- "It&#39;ll turn out to be a really filling and hearty dish, especially if you use nice, thick chunks of meat. The seasoning goes really well with plain rice as well as cold beer. Serve with your favorite vegetables on the side."
