Hey guys, Philly Boy Jay back at you with another recipe, and today I&#39;m going to show you how I prepare my Tuna Macaroni Salad. At first I was like, that is A LOT of celery, but I went with it. Such a good call - the crunch really is delightful and I can taste the celery (in a good way). The flavors are more subtle/sophisticated than your typical tuna salad, which I never got the hang of making anyway.

For my nicoise-style tuna salad, just open three cans: one each of tuna, white beans and sliced olives. Toss these ingredients with slivered red onion, olive oil and lemon juice. Take time, if you like, to boil eggs, or pick them up at the grocery salad bar. And its tuna salad, not egg salad. I know I sound like a picky perfectionist (well…), but I just don&#39;t get putting stuff in there that essentially covers up the taste of a great tuna sandwich.
