##### The ingredients needed to make Corned Beef Casserole:

1. Take 12 oz. can Corned Beef (broken up)
1. Prepare 8 oz. extra-sharp Cheddar Cheese grated (can use sharp cheddar if can&#39;t find extra-Sharp)
1. Make ready 1 C. Sweet Onion diced
1. Take 10 oz. can Cream of Chicken Soup
1. Prepare 1/2 C. Milk (any fat percent)
1. Take 6 C. Mullers Elbow Macaroni (cooked)


And, please note that we are using Corned Beef and not Corned Beef Hash, there IS a difference. Feel free to add a topping of shredded Swiss or cheddar cheese to the casserole just before it&#39;s finished baking. It&#39;s an easy change of pace from a larger boiled dinner, and it will satisfy that craving. The only difference was that I used corned beef sliced med-thin from the deli, and slices of provolone cheese instead of swiss.
