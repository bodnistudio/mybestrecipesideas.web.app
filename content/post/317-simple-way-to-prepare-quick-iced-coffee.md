First, no matter how packed with ice the glass is, once the hot coffee hits, some of the ice is bound to melt. The iced coffee isn&#39;t as cold as it could (or should) be. We used Peet&#39;s Baridi blend coffee beans, which are specially roasted for iced coffee, but any beans you like will do. Give the beans a few bursts in a coffee grinder, to a medium grind. Iced coffee brewed with cold water can be bland, but of course, there are problems with hot water, too.
