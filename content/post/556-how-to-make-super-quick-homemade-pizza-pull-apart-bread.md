- "Remove the pot from heat immediately and transfer the tangzhong into a clean bowl, and cover with clingwrap sticking onto the surface of the tangzhong to prevent it from drying up. The &#34;tangzhong&#34; can be used as soon as it cools down to room temperature. You can keep it chilled in the fridge for 2-3 days but discard it as soon as the mixture starts to turn grey."

With the dough hook, mix on low speed until the dough just comes together. Add in the salt and butter. Knead until the dough can be stretched into a thin stretchable membrane."

- "Punch down the dough and divide into 12 equal parts."
- "Using a rolling pin, flat each dough and roll into approximately a 5-6 inch disc."
- "Put one part of the filling on the top."
