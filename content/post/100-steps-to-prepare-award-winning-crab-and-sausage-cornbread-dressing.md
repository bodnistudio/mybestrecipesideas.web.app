The seafood that I use in this seafood cornbread dressing was budget friendly! I used salad shrimp, and canned lump crab. If you want to use fresh crab meat, and larger shrimp you can do so. This seafood dressing is super moist - so you don&#39;t have to worry about the shrimp or crab drying out, just FYI! This easy cornbread dressing gets a shot of something savory with the addition of sausage and a dash of pepper.
