Omuraisu is a Japanese-style omelet made with fried rice. In this version, an egg omelet is draped over ham fried rice flavored with ketchup. A plain omelet cloaks ketchup-flavored fried rice, often called &#34;chicken rice&#34; even when it&#39;s made with ham or bacon, or no meat at all. It belongs to the category of so-called Western food know as yoshoku.
