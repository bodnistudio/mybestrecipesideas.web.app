Peel and cut each potato lengthwise into eight wedges. While sweet potatoes are cooking, prepare the sauce. Add butter, maple syrup, cinnamon, and red pepper flakes to a small saucepan set over medium heat. Sweet potato skin can get crispy and maybe even a little chewy when cooked, but since they will be drenched in sauce it shouldn&#39;t be a problem here. Just make sure to wash your potatoes well to clean off any excess dirt.
