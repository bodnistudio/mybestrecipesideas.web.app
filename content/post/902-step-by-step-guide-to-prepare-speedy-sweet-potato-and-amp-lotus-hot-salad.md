The sweet potato is not closely related to the common potato (Solanum tuberosum).. Sweet potatoes are available year-round, but their flavor peaks in the fall and winter. Alton recommends choosing specimens that are heavy for their size and free of any soft spots or sprouts. Sweet potato fries are also tasty, but don&#39;t eat them often.

Baked sweet potatoes are the perfect, healthy side dish in the fall months. I like to simply eat it with some butter on top, a little goes a long way or try it with coconut oil to keep it dairy free. To save calories, omit all together and try sprinkling on cinnamon, cumin, chili powder or even pumpkin spice.. Go for thinner, uniform sweet potatoes. Although you may be tempted to pick the more meatier potato, thinner sweet potatoes will cook evenly all the way through to the center.
