People often think of salad as the back-up singer to the main event. But in Mediterranean cooking, the lines are easily blurred. Sure, we love our baked fish, grilled souvlaki, and beef kabobs, but the party is not complete without some stand-out salads. Particularly on warm days, when I&#39;d rather be basking in the sun than slaving in the kitchen, it&#39;s salad for dinnerâ€¦and no one really.
