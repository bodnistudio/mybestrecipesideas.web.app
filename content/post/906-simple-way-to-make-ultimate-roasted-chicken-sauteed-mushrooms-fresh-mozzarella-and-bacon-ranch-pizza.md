It has remained a family favorite since then. Mozzarella Cheese - you can use pre-shredded from the store, but I always recommend shredding it yourself, as it will melt better. Try our chicken pizza recipe combining the flavors of ranch dressing, chicken and our special pizza double cheese. Spoon chicken mixture over crust; top with bacon, onion and cheese. Tip: If desired, add some diced.
