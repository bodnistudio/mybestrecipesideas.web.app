- "1 liter Water"
- "1 tbsp Salt"
- "250 ml Japanese soup stock"
- "3 tbsp Sugar coarse crystal medium soft sugar if available"
- "3 tbsp Mirin"
- "3 tbsp Soy sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Soak the kampyo in water for 3 hours; change the water halfway through."
- "Drain water, sprinkle with salt (not listed), thoroughly rub it in, then rinse under running water."
- "Add the salt to water and boil over low heat for 5 minutes. It&#39;s done when you can leave a mark by pressing your nail into the kampyo."
- "Tightly squeeze the kampyo to drain excess water. Since it&#39;s hot, I used a cheese cloth."

- "Stir occasionally, and continue to simmer until the liquid has almost completely boiled out."
- "After slowly simmering for about 15 minutes, check the taste, and steam after removing it from heat. The taste should be even."
