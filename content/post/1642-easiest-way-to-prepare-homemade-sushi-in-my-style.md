Bring to a boil and add the rice. Yasuko was an amazing host and provided me with great knowledge and new techniques I was hoping to learn. We were seated promptly and the menus and water were brought over. We went for lunch and they have a great priced lunch menu where you can choose two or three rolls, which we ordered. The sushi was very fresh and tasted delicious.
