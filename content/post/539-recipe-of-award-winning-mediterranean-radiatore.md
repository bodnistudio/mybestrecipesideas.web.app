Radiatori is considered to be a newer shape, as it was just created sometime between both world wars. Its unique shape works well in soups, salads and casseroles. Fresh radiatore pasta (named for its ridged, radiator-like shape) is the quick-cooking star of tonight&#39;s late-summer pasta dish. We&#39;re tossing it with tender squash, sweet corn, and a basil-packed pesto sauce for plenty of bright, seasonal flavor. Crumbly ricotta salata cheese (an aged, pressed, and brined version of the more familiar fresh ricotta) and parsley complete the dish with.
