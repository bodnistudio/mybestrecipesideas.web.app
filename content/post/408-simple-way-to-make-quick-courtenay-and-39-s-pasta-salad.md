Rod and Ben&#39;s organic soups, made from ingredients grown within ten miles of the café, feature on the menu, alongside elegant paninis, and a wide selection of dainty Italian. For the main character, Charlie sure doesn&#39;t do much. Sure, he&#39;s the center of the story at the beginning - and again at the end - but for the meat of the book, he&#39;s doesn&#39;t get a lot of screen. Great being back in Naples enjoying a lovely evening at Campiello&#39;s under the stars. They are featuring a early dining menu getting food at a very tasty spaghetti à la Chitarra which I accompanied with a Bombay Sapphire martini.
