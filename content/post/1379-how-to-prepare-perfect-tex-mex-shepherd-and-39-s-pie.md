	<strong>Tex-Mex Shepherd&#39;s Pie</strong>. 
	This comfort dish takes advantage of a few shortcuts that don&#39;t lesson the flavor or quality of the meal, like refrigerated mashed potatoes and pico de gallo, so you can get dinner on the table fast. Make sure to brown your meat nicely, since it builds flavor. Substitute cheddar cheese for pepper jack, if you prefer it.

		This simple Shepherd&#39;s pie has a (very un-authentic) Mexican twist via the green chiles, chili powder, cumin, peppers, and corn.
	
		It was a favorite dish for my kids growing up, and I used to make it frequently.
	
		I love it because it gives the dish a little more flavour, and just a tiny bit of heat.
	
		After making my own version a few times and tweaking it up a little more each time I came up with what I&#39;m calling the Mexican Shepherd&#39;s Pie.
