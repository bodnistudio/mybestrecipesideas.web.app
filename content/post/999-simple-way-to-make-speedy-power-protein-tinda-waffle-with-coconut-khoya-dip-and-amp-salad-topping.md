The best part about this avocado chocolate mousse is that it tastes so decadent and so sinful that you completely forget you&#39;re getting so many health benefits at the same time!. While you start making your sugar syrup. Alternatively bring oil for deep frying.so that as soon as you are done frying your suryakala you can dip it in the sugar syrup. Now fry your suryakalas&#39;s on a low flame till it gets golden and crispy.
