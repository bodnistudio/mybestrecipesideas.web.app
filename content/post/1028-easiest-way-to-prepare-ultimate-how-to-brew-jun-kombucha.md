At my local farmer&#39;s market, there&#39;s a Community Table where people can sell what they make, or extra produce they have from their garden. Honey is highly beneficial and the flavor of the Jun/honey kombucha by itself, with no second fermenting, is carbonated and lovely and has its own unique benefits due to the benefits found in honey itself. Make a note, there will be more sediment at the bottom than your regular kombucha brew. Light, effervescent, sweet and slightly sour.
