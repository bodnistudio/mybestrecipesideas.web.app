I made over this healthy version using lean chicken and fresh vegetables. Baking the egg rolls instead of frying them saves even more calories and these don&#39;t disappoint! Egg rolls are usually deep fried, which really increases the calorie and fat counts. Be sure to use spring roll wrappers, which are thinner than egg roll wrappers; they will be crisp even though baked.
