Pulse garlic, Â¼ cup oil, cumin, salt, pepper, and oregano in a food processor until a paste is formed. Add the onion to the remaining liquid. Season the exposed surface of the pork with the cumin, mustard, chili powder, and brown sugar. The first time I cooked a Cuban-style pork shoulder, what came out of the oven had a glistening, charred, crisp crust, but as soon as I started carving, I realized that the stuff was rubber. It wasn&#39;t until several years later that I tasted Cuban mojo-marinated roast pork as it should be: juicy, succulent, intensely porky, and melt-in-your-mouth tender.
