- " shortening"
- " water cold"
- " salt"
- " sugar optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sift the flour into bowl. Add the shortening."
- "Rub or cut the shortening into the flour. It should look like the fat particles (shortening) are the size of peas or hazelnuts."
- "Note: if you continue to cut the fat in until it resembles cornmeal you will make a mealy pie crust which is used for wet pies or pies that have a lot of juice like fruit pies."
- "Dissolve salt and sugar in the water."
- "Add the water to the flour mixture. Mix very gently, just until the water is absorbed. Do not overwork the dough!"
- "Wrap dough with parchment paper and then plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours."
- "Note: dough might seem dry and crumbly initially but will come together during the refrigeration process."
- "Note: 4 hours is minimum refrigeration time however if you have it wrapped well you can keep it this way for several days to a week or so."
- "Scale portions of the dough as needed, roll out and place in pie tins."
- "Scaling guidelines:                9 inch bottom crust -8 oz.   9 inch top crust -6 oz.          8 inch bottom crust -6 oz.    8 inch top crust -5 oz.   These are just guidelines. Some bakers will use more or less depending on how thin crust is wanted and how experienced they are with rolling perfect rounds to eliminate excess scraps that are trimmed away."
- "Rest the dough in the pie tins (preferably in refrigerator) after trimming for 20-30 minutes. This helps prevent crust shrinkage as it bakes. You can leave pie resting in tins covered in plastic wrap in refrigerator for several days to weeks or you can freeze for longer storage as needed. Just ensure it is covered in plastic wrap well so it does not pick up odors or flavors from fridge."
- "Dock dough bottom to reduce chance of blistering.  You can also use dried beans or pie weights on parchment paper placed on top of dough if you are pre-baking the crust. Thus is done for cream filled or chiffon pies where the filling is made separate and added to a baked crust. For pies that filling bakes in pie you don&#39;t need to add pie weights,the filling will weight it down."
