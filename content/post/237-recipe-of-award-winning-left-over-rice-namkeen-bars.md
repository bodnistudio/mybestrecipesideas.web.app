Spicy murmura snack recipe a very quick to make tea time snack made with puffed rice and spices. I love anything with pori so keep trying recipes with it even if its a small variation. I love kara pori and this version is just a slight variation to it. I liked the coconut addition in this namkeen which gives a crunch in every bite.
