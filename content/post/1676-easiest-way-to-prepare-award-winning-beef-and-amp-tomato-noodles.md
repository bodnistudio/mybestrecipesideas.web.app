- "If you haven&#39;t yet cut the ginger into an inch piece, an inch thick? I really don&#39;t know how to measure out ginger sorry. Anyway, do it now! and slice the inch into the 3 big pieces or finely slice it, I don&#39;t really like eating ginger and I make big chunks so I know what to keep away.

- "Once boiling, drain the water and all the gunky stuff that&#39;ll appear on the surface of the water."
- "Fill the pan back up with cold water and repeat step 7 and 8."

- "Once boiling you can add the eggs just to boil for however long you want them(I like them hard-boiled). I&#39;m not saying how long to boil an egg for it&#39;s basic you should already know."
- "When the eggs are ready take them out and put into ice water to stop cooking further."
- "After removing the eggs, turn the heat down and simmer for around 1-3 hours, it all depends on how big or small you cut the beef, take a piece out and try it to see how tender it is. Also, crush the tomatoes into the soup they should be soft enough now and release that flavour."

- "After around an hour you can remove the lid to reduce the soup for a thicker, richer broth if you wish. If not just leave the lid slightly covered until meat is soft and tender."
