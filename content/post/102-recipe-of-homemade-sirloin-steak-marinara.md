In hindsight I wish I would have followed suit. Thank goodness l at least used fresh garlic, but I think both the lemon juice and hefty amount of garlic powder contributed a strong, &#34;off flavor,&#34; as one reviewer put it, that I just didn&#39;t care for - not so sure I liked the basil either. I like to use New York strip steaks here, other great options are rib eye, top sirloin, flank or skirt steak. Here is you just how to cook the most effective foods for your household.
