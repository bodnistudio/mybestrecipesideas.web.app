Hello everybody, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, dry fry green beans. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Dry Fry Green Beans is one of the most popular of recent trending foods on earth. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. It's enjoyed by millions daily. Dry Fry Green Beans is something that I have loved my entire life. They're fine and they look wonderful.

The secret to making Chinese green beans is a cooking technique called dry-frying&#34; (gan bian) frying the green beans until the skin starts to &#34;pucker&#34; and turn brown. Today I&#39;m sharing a very tasty stir-fry dish which, I believe, is the most delicious way to cook green beans. Fragrant, salty and pleasantly pungent, dry fried green beans (干煸四季豆) combines the classic flavour of Sichuan food &#34;Mala (麻辣, hot &amp; numbing)&#34; and the super aromatic taste of Chinese olive vegetable from Chaozhou cuisine..


To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook dry fry green beans using 11 ingredients and 14 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Dry Fry Green Beans:

1. Prepare 1 pound green beans
1. Make ready 1/2 pound chicken, pork, shrimp, tofu
1. Take 3-4 cloves garlic
1. Make ready 1 inch piece ginger
1. Get 1-2 carrots
1. Make ready 1/4-1/2 onion
1. Take 1 1/2 tablespoon fish or soy sauce
1. Prepare 1 tablespoon chili sauce (optional, to taste)
1. Prepare 1 ground black pepper to taste
1. Prepare 1 salt to taste
1. Take 3 tablespoon oil for frying


Our riff on this Chinese green bean stir-fry recipe is all about simplicity. A lot of dry-fried green bean recipes call for you to first fry the Asian-style green beans in a lot of oil, then drain the oil and quickly cook the blistered beans with lots of garlic, chili peppers and soy sauce. Inspired by salty-crunchy Sichuan dry-fried string beans (gan bian si ji dou), these green beans are shriveled and browned into delicious submission before receiving a flavor bomb of garlic, red. The green beans will be delicious regardless.

Add them into the stir-fry along with the aromatics, making sure to allow the released liquid to evaporate before adding in the green beans. Fry over middle to high fire until the skin becomes wrinkled. The following is a comparison of dry fried green beans with blanched and unblanched green beans. (Yes, I may have gone a bit overboard when recipe testing.) You can see the blanched green beans are a nice bright green color compared to the blanched green beans. They are also just slightly more tender than the raw counterpart. Sichuan Dry Fried Green Beans are a very popular dish both in China and here in the US, as Sichuan cuisine becomes more prevalent.
