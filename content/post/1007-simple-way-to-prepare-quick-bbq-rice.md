BBQ sticky rice is a fusion of flavors from Asian and the deep south. Sticky rice is typically found in Asian dishes, but this version has been kicked up southern style with a sweet and spicy BBQ sauce. BBQ + Rice, the Korean rice bowl restaurant with locations in East and West Hollywood, is exactly that kind of spot. It&#39;s a workhorse, and a very good one, at that.
