recipeingredient:
- "5 pieces Aburaage"
- "600 ml Water"
- "5 tbsp Soft light brown sugar"
- "5 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "350 grams Plain cooked rice"
- "60 ml Sushi vinegar"
- "3 tbsp Vinegar"
- "1 3 12 tablespoons Soft light brown sugar"
- "1 1/2 tsp Salt"
- "1 White sesame seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the Ingredients: Rinse and soak the rice, and cook. Cut the aburaage in half, and pour hot water over. It&#39;s amazing... the pocket in the tofu opens up on its own. Please make sure the pocket opens up and watch the heat."
- "Simmer: Add water, sugar and soy sauce in a pot and bring to a boil. Add the aburaage pieces. At the start, the aburaage will float. Press it into the pot if it does. Use enough water to cover the tofu pieces, adjust according to the size of your pot. I used an 18 cm pot."
- "Finish: Simmer at medium to high heat. For the sauce to soak through the aburaage, flip the aburaage from time to time and spoon the sauce over. After simmering for about 15 minutes on low heat, turn off the heat and let cool. The picture shows how it looks like when it&#39;s done."
- "Make the Sushi Rice - After the rice has been cooked, sprinkle with sushi vinegar and mix in a cut-and-fold motion. If you don&#39;t have any sushi vinegar, mix the condiments in a bowl and use that in place of the sushi vinegar."
- "Stuff the Sushi Rice 1: Divide the sushi rice into 10 equal parts. Squeeze the chilled aburaage slightly, and stuff each with a portion of rice. If you squeeze the aburaage too hard, it won&#39;t be juicy anymore. Just make sure that the sauce doesn&#39;t drip. A light press would be OK."
- "Stuff the Sushi Rice 2: After you have stuffed the opened aburaage with rice, close the skin as shown in the picture. If you stuff it with less rice, it&#39;s easier to close up the tofu. Make sure to not break the skin. Once you are done, simply place it on a plate with the opened end facing the bottom. Now you can have a hearty meal of juicy inari sushi!"
- "Serve: Here I turned the aburaage inside out and stuffed them with sushi rice mixed with white sesame."
- "Notes: This isn&#39;t sweet like the ready-made mixes or store-bought inarizushi. Adjust the flavor by changing the amount of sugar and mirin. It&#39;s also fine to decrease the amount of soy sauce."
- "COOKPAD user &#34;Harupii&#34; packed the inarizushi in bentos. It&#39;s so cute with faces! What a wonderful transformation!"
