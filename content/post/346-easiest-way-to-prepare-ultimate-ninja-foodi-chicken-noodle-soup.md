recipeinstructions:
- "With the basket inserted into the nanoceramic liner, add chicken, 48oz chicken broth, and sprinkle chicken generously with thyme. Add a dash of cracked pepper and salt also. Put on pressure cooker lid and set valve to seal position. Set to pressure cooker, hi, 20 minutes. Press start."
