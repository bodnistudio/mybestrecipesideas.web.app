Whisk the eggs in a container with a spout until they&#39;re about half mixed, but there are still some areas with pure egg white and egg yolk. In a small frying pan, about the diameter of the bowl you plan to serve your Oyakodon in, add the dashi, sake, soy sauce, sugar, and onions, breaking up any clumps of onion as you add them. Combine dashi, soy sauce, sake, sugar, and mirin in a small saucepan or donburi pan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Meanwhile, beat together eggs and scallions in a small bowl. Chicken Egg Tempura Don is a dish made by S≈çma Yukihira after he had a conversation with Erina Nakiri.
