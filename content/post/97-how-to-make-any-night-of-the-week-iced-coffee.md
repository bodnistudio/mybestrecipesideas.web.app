##### Instructions to make Iced Coffee:

1. Make coffee. Make simple syrup. Put sugar and water in a small sausepan .Heat on stove. Till sugar is dissolved. Allow coffee and syrup to cool completely.
1. Add coffee and simple syrup and miilk. Stir together.  Keep refrigerated. Enjoy.


First, no matter how packed with ice the glass is, once the hot coffee hits, some of the ice is bound to melt. The iced coffee isn&#39;t as cold as it could (or should) be. We used Peet&#39;s Baridi blend coffee beans, which are specially roasted for iced coffee, but any beans you like will do. Give the beans a few bursts in a coffee grinder, to a medium grind. Iced coffee brewed with cold water can be bland, but of course, there are problems with hot water, too.
