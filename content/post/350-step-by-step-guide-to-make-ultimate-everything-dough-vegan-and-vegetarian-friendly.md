recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl add in sugar and salt, and mix together. Move sugar and salt mixture to one side of the bowl. On the other side dump in yeast packet."
- "Run the sink as hot as you can get it out of the faucet. Once hot water is ready pour hot water in with dry ingredients. Do not pour water directly over yeast. Doing so could kill the yeast if the water is to hot."

- "Once you can see the foam forming in the yeast mixture. Add in flour. Add flour in one cup at a time stiring consistently."
