Hello everybody, it is John, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we're going to make a special dish, omelette with rice. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Omurice is a Japanese word for &#34;omelet and rice&#34; and is an omelet wrapped around fried rice and topped with ketchup--a perfect example of Western influence on Japanese cuisine. In Japan, you will find omurice cooked at home and served at Western-style diners. Place the omelet on top of the rice and run a knife length-wise through the top layer of the omelet.

##### The ingredients needed to make Omelette with rice:

1. Prepare  eggs
1. Get  rice
1. Prepare  Black pepper


Turn the omelet onto a paper towel, using the towel to put the edges of the egg together to seal in a football/omelet shape. Repeat the process with the egg and rice mixtures to make the second omelet. I used red whole grain rice which gave it a nutty flavor that white rice can t give. Using a spiralizer to cut the carrot and cucumber reduced cooking time.

##### Instructions to make Omelette with rice:

1. 3 eggs in a bowl

Leftover rice is best used for this recipe, as the day-old rice will be more dry and easier to fry. If you&#39;re going to be using a new batch of rice, make sure to reduce the amount of water you use or it will be too moist. Use a non-stick pan for making the omelette. Since wild rice is plentiful here, I love to create recipes starring that crunchy staple. Pork sausage helps spice up the mild rice flavor in this hearty omelet, which is draped with a silky-smooth cheese sauce.
