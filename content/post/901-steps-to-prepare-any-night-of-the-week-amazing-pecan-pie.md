	<strong>Amazing Pecan Pie</strong>. 
	Pecan Pie is always a favorite with my family and this one is dynamite! One thing that should be in the instructions is that the water and corn starch are mixed together before adding to the sugar mixture. I sometimes forget and add the water before I remember to mix it with the starch.
