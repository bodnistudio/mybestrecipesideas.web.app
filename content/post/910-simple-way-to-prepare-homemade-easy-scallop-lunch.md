I cook the scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that&#39;s gives the dish more flavor and they&#39;re still tender and moist. I think you&#39;ll agree, the sherry sauce benefits significantly from the longer cook time. Lunch Dinner. (but equally tasty) option, try using shrimp in place of the scallops. Seared scallops are so easy and pair so well with the crispy, buttery flavor of the bacon and fresh navel oranges.
