- "This is best if you allow it to sit and marinate overnight, but I tend to hate waiting. Soooo if you can wait 10 minutes, you&#39;re fine."

- "Once the chicken becomes somewhat sticky and brown like the photo and the chicken is fully cooked, it&#39;s time to enjoy."
- "I served this over steamed cabbage and drizzled the reserved marinade from step 2."
