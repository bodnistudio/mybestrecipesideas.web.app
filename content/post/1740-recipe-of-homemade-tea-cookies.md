There&#39;s no feeling quite as blissful as your first bite of one of these cookies. Whether you call them Russian tea cakes, Mexican wedding cookies or snowballs, there&#39;s no denying that they&#39;re essential to bake during the Christmas season. A shortbread-like dough, studded with chopped nuts, bakes up to a texture that&#39;s beautifully sandy and tender, never dry or crumbling to bits. Some people say tea cakes remind them of sugar cookies but I think they remind me more of sweet cornbread or pound cake in cookie-biscuit form. They pretty much BEG for tea or coffee.
