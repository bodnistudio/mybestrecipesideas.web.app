Millionaire&#39;s Shortbread: To make the British classic millionaire&#39;s shortbread, simply reduce the salt to a pinch in the caramel, and omit it from the top too. Shortbread should be slightly cooled- mine usually goes from the oven to the freezer and sits for about ten minutes before I pour on the caramel. It will not ruin the shortbread, I promise.

I use dark chocolate instead of milk to level off the sweetness of the caramel a bit. Imagine the most buttery, delicious shortbread and then add a layer of homemade caramel followed by a layer of chocolate. Then imagine sinking your teeth through all three layers - chewing, swallowing, sighing, repeating…it really just doesn&#39;t get any better! To be sure, Millionaire&#39;s Shortbread is rich. I received many wonderful family recipes but, in the end, these Chocolate Caramel Shortbread Squares of Scottish origin won me over.
