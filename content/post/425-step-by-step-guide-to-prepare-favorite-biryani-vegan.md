I highly recommend using extra-long grain aged basmati rice for biryani. Biryani is a traditional Indian recipe made with basmati rice, a sauce (made with yogurt), lots of spices and a type of meat, such as lamb or chicken. Vegan Biryani is quite a popular version of this meat-based dish. The yogurt sauce can be replaced by cashews and the meat by soy chunks. The rest of the ingredients remain pretty much the same.
