- "Once I mopped up my counter, I poured the watermelon and simple syrup into a freezer safe container. Then I very precisely added lime juice, I actually just dumped some in tasted and added until it was where I wanted it... I&#39;d say about 2 Tbsp. but go with what you like..."
- "Then I put the container in the refrigerator, because sometimes I do things that do not make sense. At least it wasn&#39;t putting milk in the pantry, not that I have ever done that..."
- "Sometime later I realized my rushed mistake and with fingers crossed put the container in the freezer, that freezes stuff, right. An hour before dinner and hot from the summer heat I confirmed that my sorbet would not be dessert this evening...."
- "Motherhood and cooking are big on improvisation.... I decided to make watermelon ice cream sundaes... Equal amounts of vanilla ice cream, and water melon slush, Redi Wip, chocolate syrup. It was stupid good. But melts fast, so move it people! :)"
