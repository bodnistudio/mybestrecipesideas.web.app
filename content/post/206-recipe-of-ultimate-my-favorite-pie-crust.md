	<strong>My Favorite Pie Crust</strong>. 
	This is my favorite, no fail, all butter, buttermilk pie crust. I use it for pretty much every pie I make, including this pretty cherry pie, this yummy I prefer an all butter crust (always all butter!) with a mix of all-purpose flour and almond meal. I LOVE the slight texture and heartiness the almond meal gives.

<h3>Instructions to make My Favorite Pie Crust:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Combine salt and sugar with flour.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Toss the cold cubed margarine into the flour mixture.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cut diced margarine into the flour mixture (use pastry cutter or two knifes) until the margarine is the size of coarse peas..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Gradually add the water mixture into the flour until a dough can be formed. You may need to add more water, but add a tablespoon at a time.You know you have added enough water when you grab a handful of the dough and it doesn&#39;t break apart..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Combine the dough and form into a ball. Do not overwork the dough..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Divide the dough into two balls of dough. Wrap both in plastic wraps and rest in the refrigerator for at least a half hour..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Remove one dough from the refrigerator. Liberally flour your work surface and your rolling pin. Gradually roll the dough into a circle. Make sure you roll your dough to be about an inch more than your pie plate..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			I used a pot cover as a guide to cut the dough so that I can get a perfect circle..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			I personally oiled and floured my pie plate before putting the pie dough in it..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place your rolled pie dough into your pie plate..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Follow the same step of rolling your dough for the top pie crust. Only make the size of the circle smaller..
			
			
		</li>
