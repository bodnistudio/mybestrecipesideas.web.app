It&#39;s seriously easy to make - no oven needed - and the combination of the chilled rich mocha flavor and crunchy cookie crust borders on celestial. Chocolate, coffee, butter, sweetened condensed milk, eggs and vanilla melt and mingle on the stovetop, and is poured into an unbaked pie shell.

Mocha Filling: Featuring a thick brownie crust, a filling made of creamy mocha pudding, and--for the crowning touch--a coffee-and-Kahl√∫a whipped topping, it&#39;s hard to believe this pie could be light. I couldn&#39;t tell you when the craving for a mocha pie originated, only that it is a desire I have been trying to ignore for the better part of a year. My affections lie firmly in the fruit pie camp, which is why the urge for a rich pudding of dark chocolate and coffee, tucked into a flaky crust and topped with mounds of espresso whipped cream was a mystery to me. Your favorite drink, now in pie form. Hmm, that&#39;s all I have to say about ingredients.
