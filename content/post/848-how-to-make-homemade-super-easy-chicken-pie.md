		There are so many cherished memories attached to pot pie for me.
	
		That simple comfort food had a way to relieve stress, I swear. chicken breasts - boneless, skinless chicken breast, or leftover rotisserie chicken works great!; frozen mixed vegetables, onion and garlic - frozen veggies work great here, the only chopping you&#39;ll do is the onions and garlic.; cream of chicken soup, milk, cheddar cheese - perfect to make an easy creamy gravy for this pie.; pie crust - take a shortcut and use a pre-made pie crust.
	
		Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
	
		If you need to get dinner on the table in a hurry, this easy chicken pot pie recipe is the place to begin.
