Onions, garlic, turnips, carrots, herbs, spices, and stout come together to add tremendous flavor to chunky oxtail. The pressure cooker makes quick work of tenderizing and extracting flavor from the beef oxtails when standard simmering would take twice as long.. Just set your pressure cooker before you. Season the oxtail with salt and add it to the casserole along with the herbs. Pour in the red wine and bring it to the boil.
