Hey everyone, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, mix pasta salad. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

This light and refreshing cold pasta salad is loaded with the flavors of the Mediterranean, and pairs well with grilled proteins, such as fish, pork, chicken or steak. If you make this in advance, reserve a bit of the dressing to add right before serving, as the pasta has a tendency to soak up the dressing as it sits over time. Try a new take on pasta salad by adding tuna, wagon wheels, white beans and a creamy dressing with lemon juice, sour cream and mixed herbs Photo By: Kang Kim Pasta Salad with Salami, Carrots, Peas.
