<h3>Instructions to make Greek spinach pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Shimmer without oil the spinach and the leeks till get soft. We put them in a strainer to take all the water out..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a bowl we put the feta, parmesan, yogurt, dill, salt, pepper and eggs and we mix till the feta becomes crumbly..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			We pass in a fry pan the onions and we add some oil (1 tsp) the spinach and leeks. We cook them for 2 minutes in low heat. After we put them in strainer in order to cool down.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			When they will be in a good temperature (room temperature) we mix them with the cheeses and yogurt..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			We take the tray pan we put some oil at the bottom in order not to get sticky the filo. We put 3 filo sheets at the bottom (every filo sheets we put little oil so they get crunchy), we put the spinach filling and we spread in the tray evenly. Then we put one filo sheet above the filling, some oil and again some filing. After the second filling we put the 3 remaining filo sheets (and again in between sheets some oil)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In the preheated oven of 180 degrees in the air we put the tray for around 45 minutes. After 15 minutes take the tray and with a knife cut the first filo in a square design in order to allow even cooking for all filo sheets. Check with a fork after 30 minutes to see if its cooked. If your oven is strong then low the heat in order to cook till the base the pita. Enjoyyyyy !!!!.
