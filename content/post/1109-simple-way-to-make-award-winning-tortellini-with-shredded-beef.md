Not only is it tasty, but so easy and perfect for those busy weeknights! Ingredients Needed for Cheesy Beef Tortellini: Stew meat The famous Italian dish, Tortellini en brodo, is a beautiful, well-known holiday pasta and broth soup upon which my simplified, shredded-beef American version is based. I truly didn&#39;t have this dish in mind, I just happened to have a pot roast, a bunch of tortellini, and a desire for something besides the things I usually make with pot roast on a cold snowy day: pot roast and vegetables. Then I added the pasta sauce.

I used one pound of frozen cheese tortellini cooked according to the instructions on the package. Those three ingredients were combined and poured into the baking pan. About one and a half cups of shredded mozzarella were used - two just seemed like too much to me. Add the refrigerated tortellini to the sauce mixture and fold until the cheesy sauce coats all of the tortellini evenly. Pour the tortellini and sauce into the prepared baking dish and make sure the top is even.
