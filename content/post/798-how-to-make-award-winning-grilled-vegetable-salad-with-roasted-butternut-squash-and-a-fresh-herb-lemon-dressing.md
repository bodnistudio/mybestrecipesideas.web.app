Today&#39;s salad is enjoyed cold with hearty vegetables that last a while in the. A little bit of fat in the dressing and on the grilled or roasted vegetables (and maybe even in that pat of butter, if you choose to include it) helps your body to absorb the fat-soluble nutrients in the fresh produce. Be sure to wash your produce well, cleaning any dirt from the sweet potatoes wit a vegetable brush. I now keep this fresh herby lemon vinaigrette on hand for so many more reasons than originally intended. It&#39;s wonderful drizzled over fresh tomatoes or any grilled or roasted vegetables.
