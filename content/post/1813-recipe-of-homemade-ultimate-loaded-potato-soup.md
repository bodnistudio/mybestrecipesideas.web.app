This potato soup has more flavor than any potato soup I have ever had. It is a bit salty due to the bouillon cubes but you can add more milk to dilute if you find it necessary. For less creamy and lower fat, use whole milk instead of half-and-half -- still tastes great! When done, the tip of a paring knife should go through the potatoes easily. Set a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
