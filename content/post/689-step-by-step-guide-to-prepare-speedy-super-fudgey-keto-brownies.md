recipeingredient:
- "9 Tbsp unsalted butter"
- "2 3 C Xylotil or sugar substitute to taste"
- "11 tbsp cocoa powder"
- "3 eggs room temp"
- "3 4 C almond flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Position a rack in the lower third of your oven and preheat to 350째F/180째C. Line with parchment paper the bottom and sides of a 8x8-inch baking pan. Set aside."
- "Add butter, sweetener (stevia does not work!), cocoa powder and salt to a medium heatproof bowl."
- "Melt this mixture over a water bath whisking constantly (or use the microwave, in small increments). You&#39;ll want to heat it up until most of the sweetener has melted and the mixture is well incorporated (note that erythritol, unlike xylitol, won&#39;t dissolve much at this point). Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly."
- "Add one egg at a time, whisking well after each one until completely incorporated. The texture should appear smooth, with all the sweetener dissolving into the mixture. And if using erythritol, and your batter ends up too thick, you may want to add an extra egg. Just be sure not to over-whisk, or your brownies could end up more cakey rather than fudgy."
- "Add the almond flour, whisking vigorously until fully blended (about a minute)."
- "Bake for 10-20 minutes (we do about 23 with xylitol and 17 with erythritol), or until the center is just set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out moist. This really does vary (a lot!!) from oven to oven (think convection etc), so give them a check from minute 15 the first time around, and remember that your brownies will continue to cook while they cool."
- "Sprinkle with flakey sea salt (optional) and allow to cool completely on a rack. Lift brownies using the edges of the parchment paper and cut into desired size (we do 16!). To get extra clean edges, place in the freezer for 10 minutes prior to cutting."

Hey everyone, it is me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, super fudgey keto brownies. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Super Fudgey Keto Brownies is one of the most favored of recent trending foods in the world. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions daily. They are nice and they look wonderful. Super Fudgey Keto Brownies is something which I've loved my entire life.

Just like a good keto fudge, the key to super fudgy keto brownies is plenty of fat. Fudgy keto brownies are done when an inserted toothpick comes out almost clean, but not quite. It should have a little batter left on it, which you can ball up between your fingers.


To get started with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have super fudgey keto brownies using 5 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Super Fudgey Keto Brownies:

1. Prepare 9 Tbsp unsalted butter
1. Prepare 2 \3 C Xylotil or sugar substitute to taste
1. Prepare 11 tbsp cocoa powder
1. Get 3 eggs room temp
1. Prepare 3 \4 C almond flour


Fold to incorporate the dry ingredients, being careful not to overmix as this will cause the brownies to be more cake-like in texture. Fold in the chocolate chunks, then. These brownies combine a fudge brownie&#39;s ultra-moist texture with a subtle cake-like rise, for the best of both worlds. I can never decide between cakey or fudgey brownies, and these are a perfect happy medium!
