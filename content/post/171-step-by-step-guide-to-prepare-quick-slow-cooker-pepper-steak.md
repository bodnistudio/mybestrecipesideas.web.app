It utilizes tons of fresh flavors, like onion, garlic, and bell pepper, and is all cooked down in a zippy pepper sauce. Cooked low and slow, this steak recipe produces a dish that is fork tender and completely drool worthy. I love to serve this over fluffy white rice, with all that liquid in the pot spooned over generously. Combine the onion, soy sauce, garlic, sugar, salt, ginger and pepper; pour over beef. Combine cornstarch and cold water until smooth; gradually stir into slow.
