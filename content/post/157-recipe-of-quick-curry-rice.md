This rice tasted pretty good but the mix of curry powder and soy sauce didn&#39;t make for a very appealing color. I would recommend omitting the soy sauce and adding some turmeric and/or saffron for a really &#34;curry&#34; color. Curry rice is a versatile dish that lends itself to many recipe variations. For instance, it&#39;s not difficult to add plenty of vegetables to make something resembling a stir fry.
