Made this recipe tonight for my family. My dad is very sensitive to spice so I left out the sriracha and red pepper flakes, but it was still DIVINE. One of the most popular Chinese takeout dishes, this features succulent beef with broccoli, onions and bean sprouts tossed in a phenomenally delicious sauce! One of the things I love about Chinese food - aside from the fact that it tastes so darn delicious - is how quick it is to make. Stir soy sauce mixture; add to pan.
