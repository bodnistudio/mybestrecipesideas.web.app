Toasted pine nuts add flavor and crunch. And, finally, mozzarella pearls and fresh basil jazz the whole dish up. To assemble the pasta salad, pour all of the pesto over the pasta and toss until the pasta is lightly and evenly coated, adding a tiny splash of reserved pasta cooking water if necessary to thin it out. Then add the cherry tomatoes, arugula, remaining toasted pepitas, and any optional add-ins (olives, chickpeas and/or cheese). Pasta salads are the ultimate summer move, especially when it&#39;s too hot to use the oven.
