As with most meat, the safest way to thaw beef is in the refrigerator. Using the broiler lets you enjoy the taste of kebabs year-round; they are also great cooked on the grill. Traditionally white rice is used, but sometimes I like to use brown rice for a heartier, healthier porridge with a subtle nutty flavor. Heartier vegetables such as kale, escarole, shiitakes, leeks, and even Brussels sprouts are perfect in it. Once heated add chicken and cook thru.
