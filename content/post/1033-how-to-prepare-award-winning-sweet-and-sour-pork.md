What is Sweet and Sour Pork? Sweet and Sour Pork is an iconic Chinese recipe and classic Cantonese dish. Called &#34;咕嚕肉&#34; or &#34;goo lou yok&#34; in Cantonese dialect, this recipe is very pleasing to the palate because of the flavorsome sweet and sour sauce—the sweetness from sugar plus the tangy ketchup and sharp rice vinegar—with the crispy fried pork pieces. Sweet and sour pork is arguably one of the most popular Chinese dishes in the United States, but as with most classic dishes, it&#39;s difficult to find a go-to recipe.
