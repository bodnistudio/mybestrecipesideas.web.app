We eat rice with most meals (Filipino/Vietnamese household) and collect the leftover rice from the week in a container in the fridge. Come Saturday morning, leftover bits of meat and veg from the week get thrown into the pan along with the rice. Add an egg — instant breakfast! Unlike other breakfast fried rice recipes, this is made with naturally gluten free brown rice, turkey bacon (it&#39;s a great way to get the taste of bacon without all the bacon grease), and the sesame oil that&#39;s usually in fried rice is left out. Crumble sausage into a skillet; cook over medium heat until no longer pink.
