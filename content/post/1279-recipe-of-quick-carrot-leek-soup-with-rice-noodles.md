- "Let simmer for 20 minutes in a rolling boil"
- "Grind spices (together) in a coffee grinder"

- "Add the prepared rice noodles"
- "Cool and..."
- "Enjoy!"
- "Notes: make sure to wash the vegetables after you cut them. You can wash them together (that’s what I did). Give the soup a consistent boil. Make sure your carrots and leeks aren’t cut small because it will affect the texture of the soup. Also, cook the soup on high to maintain a consistent temperature with the soup. Your average temperature should be 150 degrees F. Make sure your spices are grinder together or the soup won’t taste right."
- "More notes: never let the soup off a boil. Use a big pan to make sure the soup does not boil over when you cook it. Their should be a lot more broth than vegetables in the pot. It’s normal. The point is to just get the taste from the carrots and leeks into the broth. If your kids don’t like carrots or leeks. Bake the soup for 40 minutes straight (with everything in it) then strain out the vegetables and it will be just as good!"
- "Even more notes!: when your cooking the soup, stir the soup every 12 minutes with a soup spoon. Adding more spices is not necessary but can be done! If you want your soup to have a way overpowering flavor, triple each spice. Refrigerated carrots work best because they are easier to peel and chop, but room temperature carrots will work too! I always use organic vegetables because it gives you a better health benefit but you can use whatever!"
- "Last notes: add the salt and pepper last. The reason I keep the soup in a bowl is because, it keeps the soup hot and it stirs the soup for you! The boil will move the broth around to stir up the vegetables and spices. You can add however much salt and pepper you want to your taste! I hope you enjoy this recipe!"
- "Health benefits: carrots and leeks are especially good for your immune system! The carrots are orange which (by the color) will also help your eye sight! Leeks are a powering and resourceful vegetable. They will (in no time) help you get out of bed in the morning!"
- "This recipe is great for the winter and the cold! Enjoy!!"
