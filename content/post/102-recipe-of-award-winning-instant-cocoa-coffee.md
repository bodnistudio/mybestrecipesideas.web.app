Hello everybody, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to make a special dish, instant cocoa coffee. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Instant cocoa coffee is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It is simple, it is fast, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions every day. They are nice and they look fantastic. Instant cocoa coffee is something which I've loved my whole life.

Instant coffee may not taste great on its own, but it&#39;ll satisfy the coffee fix. Adding cocoa and cinnamon can make a world of difference. Cocoa mixes may be those that have dry milk included (only needing water) or those that require being mixed with milk.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have instant cocoa coffee using 6 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Instant cocoa coffee:

1. Take 10 cup water
1. Make ready 5 tbsp instant coffee
1. Get 2 tsp ground nutmeg
1. Prepare 1 1/2 tsp almond extract
1. Get 2 tbsp vanilla extract
1. Make ready  sugar


Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. (Any strong coffee will do, whether that&#39;s a couple shots of espresso or a concentrated brew made with your preferred method.) It&#39;s worth noting that different types of cocoa powder will yield slightly different results in this recipe, with natural cocoa powder creating a more acidic, fruity flavor, while Dutch-processed cocoa will be earthier. The mocha dalgona coffee is also a good option for cocoa lovers who want to keep the jolt from the instant coffee. But putting cocoa in coffee is tasty and not harmful, so it might be worth a try. In fact, it might be the thinking person&#39;s drink.

I love coffee and I love flavoured coffee even more. Instead of milk though I used my french vanilla flavoured dairy creamer. I tend to like my coffee a little sweeter. Both cocoa and coffee begin as beans. Although both cocoa and coffee drinks can be high in calories, there are benefits to both foods.
