recipeinstructions:
- "Line two half sheet pans with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Set them aside."
- "Place the white chocolate chips and coconut oil into a large, microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 1 minute, stopping at the 30 second mark to stir.

Once it&#39;s completely melted and smooth, stir in the pumpkin pie spice, then drizzle the melted dark chocolate over the tops of the coated pretzels."
- "Place the pretzels back in the fridge for 15-20 more minutes, then they should be set and ready to eat. You can store these in an airtight container at room temperature or if your kitchen is on the warmer side (as in regularly above 74°ish), then store them in the fridge. They will keep for about 4 days."
