- "1 lb. Taco meat your favorite"
- "2 corn tortillas fried"
- " Cabbage thinly sliced"
- " Tomato"
- " Avocado"
- " Sharp cheddar cheese"
- " Plain Greek yogurt or sour cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the taco meat. My preference whether beef/chicken/pork/turkey is cumin heavy and spicy. When I make it out ground turkey I mix the spices in a food processor with oil, apple cider vinegar and taco bell mild sauce. Then I mix that into the turkey and let sit in the fridge for a minimum of an hour. When cooking I have the skillet on medium high to keep from getting that weird juicy white fat stuff and also use a can of green chilies."
- "Fry the corn tortillas"
- "Slice the cabbage, tomatoes and avocados. I used cabbage in place of lettuce to make this more of a hearty dish plus I like the flavor combo. Also with it being extra filling you can skip refried beans, saving some dishes to do on a weeknight is also great!"
- "Load the bowl with the cabbage then top with the taco meat. This will lightly soften the cabbage. Load up the rest of the toppings and don&#39;t forget the fried tortilla on the side."
