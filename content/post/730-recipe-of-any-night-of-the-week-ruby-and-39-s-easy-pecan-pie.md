		I am a Mom to a blended Korean / Mexican American family that loves to share what I cook in my home.
	
		Most pecan pie recipes I&#39;ve found call for two cups of sugar—one cup of corn syrup plus one cup of either granulated or brown sugar.
	
		I find that just a bit too sweet for my taste, so for this pecan pie recipe, I&#39;ve dropped the sugar down by half a cup.
	
		Feel free to reduce further or add more to your taste.

		Pecan pie is one of my most favorite desserts - this instructable will show you how to do it right!
	
		I do NOT approve of these faux pecan pies I see everywhere with only a I then attempted to reconstruct a piece of pie (it&#39;s notoriously hard to cut a nice piece of pecan pie) and make food nom noms!
	
		First, whip up the pie crust: Mix the flour and salt in a bowl.
	
		Add the vegetable shortening and salted butter.
	
		Work the butter into the flour using a dough cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles.
