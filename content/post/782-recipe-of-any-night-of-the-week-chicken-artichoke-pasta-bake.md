Chicken, bacon, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, and spinach are tossed with chewy pasta then smothered in a luscious creamy garlic and herb sauce. I&#39;d say the taste is nearly identical!! Pour the sauce over the chicken and artichokes. Drizzle with the reserved artichoke marinade. Salt and pepper the chicken breast halves and place in the dish.
