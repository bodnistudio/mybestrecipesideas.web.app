- " herbal teabags"

- " gelatin powder"
- " sugar"
- " butter"
- " ground cinnamon"
- " vanilla extract"
- " warm water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Empty the can of coconut milk into a medium saucepan, and set to medium heat. Add the butter and let it melt."
- "Once the milk is heated, drop in the herbal teabags to infuse. I used Rooibos, a South African herbal tea. Chai should work just as well, but feel free to experiment. I&#39;d be interested to know what works."
- "Once the milk is properly infused with your herbal tea, remove the teabags. Add the sugar and bring it up to a simmer. Let it reduce for like 10 mins or so."
- "Meanwhile,  activte the gelatin powder by sprinkling it on the warm water and stirring untill it dissolves completely. Be careful not to use boiling water at this point, because that might damage the microscopic gelatinous strands or something. Whoever feels like googling can let me know if you find out the real reason."
- "Bring down the heat on the saucepan and add the gelatin. Again make sure that the gelatin never boils, because of reasons. Mix it through and add the vanilla and cinnamon to taste. Let it cool down for a smidge."
- "Pour the cooled mixture into greased molds. Ice trays or shot glasses work well. The soft rubbery kind works best, because these little dudes like to stick around, and it helps a lot if you can help them along from behind."
- "Refrigerate for 2 hours, and remove them from the molds. Encourage them along the edges with a sharp knife if you&#39;re using a hard mold and they&#39;re being stubborn."
- "These guys will keep their shape for a couple of hours at room temperature because of the obscene amount of gelatin used, but they still need to be refrigerated to keep them from melting/spoiling in the long term. They are preservative free after all."
