recipeingredient:
- "1/2 cup kosher salt or more as needed"
- "8 Meyer lemons or any type of lemon"
- "4 Meyer lemons for juicing"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash lemons thoroughly, giving them a good scrub"
- "Prepare a glass jar large enough to hold all lemons by washing thoroughly with hot soapy water"
- "Cut each lemon in half lengthwise, stopping about 1/4-1/2 inch at base. Cut again lengthwise so that the lemon is cut into quarters but the pieces are still attached at the base and you are able to separate the quarters a bit"
- "Add 2 tbsp salt to bottom of jar"
- "Separate quarters of each lemon and generously sprinkle salt on all surfaces of the inside of the lemon"
- "As each lemon is salted, place in jar, pushing down with a wooden spoon to release juices"
- "When all lemons are in the jar and have been pressed, pour remaining salt on top, or add 2 tbsp if needed"
- "Juice remaining lemons and add juice to jar so that lemons are fully covered (usually 2-4 lemons)"
- "Place lid on jar and leave for 3-4 days (room temperature) turning the jar upside down occasionally to distribute juices"
- "After 3-4 days, refrigerate for at least 3 weeks but will keep indefinitely"
- "To use preserved lemons, remove lemon quarters as needed, rinse under tap water (to remove salt), separate the rind and the pulp. Discard pulp. The rind (including the pith) is most commonly used."
- "The rind will be soft, have a muted color and have a somewhat translucent appearance. The flavor will be intense but lack the mouth-puckering tartness of a raw lemon. Use in stews, sauces, dressings, almost anywhere you would use raw lemon."
