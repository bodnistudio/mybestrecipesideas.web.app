House special fried rice is one of my favorite things to order when I crave Asian food and I am thrilled to share my take on it on the blog. Using a wooden spoon or silicon spatula, continue to stir and move eggs around in the hole created until cooked, then stir into meat and vegetables to blend fully. The key to a crispy fried rice is patience. I designed this recipe to work well in a regular skillet (preferably cast iron), since most of us don&#39;t have woks at home.
