recipeingredient:
- "400 grams Chinese fat noodles 1 inch width Typically 1 in width for traditional style  However you can get the folded up sheets and cut it into any width you prefer or buy percut ones if no preference  Make sure the noodle is NOT TOO WET  It should be mil"
- "100 grams thin sliced beef The kind used for hot pot with relatively higher fat to muscle ratio  The fatties the better"
- "1 whole white onion cut in wedges"
- "100 grams Optional starchy or tough vegetable ie peapods broccoli stem etc"
- "3 tbsp soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp oyster sauce or 1 tbsp of Hondashi Japanese dried fish stock"
- "1/2 tbsp sugar"
- "2 tbsp cooking rice wine or any cooking alcohol you find really"
- "1 Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat up a large non-stick skillet (or frying pan) under HIGH heat until it is sizzling hot.  (I like to use a skillet because the higher raised lip limit the extend of flying grease when pan-frying and stops things from falling out of the skillet.)"
- "Drop in the thin sliced beef in bundles (3-4 slices) directly into the skillet."
- "Brown the meat on both sides for a good 7 second.   Tips: 1) Give each bundle enough space apart (at least 1/2 inch apart) to prevent juice from pooling.  2) Limit movement of the meat during browning to prevent sticking.  3) Ideally, it&#39;s brown on the outside and raw on the inside. You will cook them again the noodle later.  If too cooked, it will dry up."
- "Remove the skillet from heat."
- "Extract the meat with chopsticks or tongs when the meat is properly browned on both surfaces.  Leave the rendered grease in the skillet for the next step."
- "Add the onion, the peapods, and a pinch of salt into the skillet and cook under HIGH heat until soften.  Tips:  Typically around 30 seconds.  Stir often.  I usually pop the lid on and whirl the content around instead for quicker result.  It effectively &#34;braises&#34; the veggies along with frying."
- "Add the noodles into the skillet."
- "There should still be a layer of grease remains on the skillet.  If so, stir it around until the noodle start to loosen up.  If not a lot of grease, let it sit on the skillet for a bit before stirring.  (If your non-stick surface is good, you shouldn&#39;t have any sticking.)  Let all sides of the noodle cook for a bit until the skillet is dried of grease or moisture."
- "Add the beef back to the skillet"
- "Add the soy sauce, cook wine, sugar, oyster sauce (or Hondashi)"
- "Stir until the sauce is evenly distributed.  In the case that you do have some sticking on your skillet, scrap the bottom with a spatula.  (The cooking wine should be able to remove any sticking bits.  Those are favor packets, courtesy of your sticky skillet.)"
- "Remove from heat once the sauce coats all the noodles and the noodles became soft."
- "Taste and adjust the taste to your liking.  Add soy sauce if taste too bland.  Add sugar to balance if taste too &#34;sharp&#34; (too salty).  Add more oyster sauce if the favor is doesn&#39;t have enough &#34;weight&#34; (favor doesn&#39;t stick to your palates or the favor fades quickly)."
- "Enjoy!"
