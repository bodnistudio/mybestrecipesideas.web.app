recipeingredient:
- " powdered sugar"
- " almond powder"
- " egg white about 2 eggs"
- " granulated sugar"
- " powdered green tea matcha"
- " some sweet red bean paste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Push the almond powder through a tamis and then add the powdered sugar and the matcha. Then sift them together."
- "Beat the egg white, adding the granulated sugar in two times, and beat them until stiff peaks form."
- "Add the powders into the egg white, I usually do it in two times. With a spatula, try to turn the mixture over so that the foam won&#39;t break down too much."
- "When it&#39;s roughly mixed, do the &#34;macaronage&#34;. Using a skepper, push the mixture onto the bowl to break the extra bubbles. It&#39;s done when the surface is shiny and it drops smoothly but not too liquid."
- "Put it in a piping bag. Use a silicon sheet for macarons if you have. If not, use the baking sheet. I also put a sheet of carton paper under the baking (or silicon) sheet. Pipe the dough on the sheet, keep it upright, until about 2 cm. Keep enough distance to other macarons."
- "Leave them for several hours to dry until they make skins. It takes many hours in the humid weather."
- "Bake in the oven preheated at 160 degree C for about 13-4 minutes. They make cracks when the lower heat is too strong, and they bust when the upper heat is weak, so I put them on the top position (very close to the ceiling of the oven). Turn the board in the middle of the baking."
- "Cool them down and remove from the sheet. Spread the bean paste or ganache on a macaron coque and bind with another. Enjoy!"
