Hey everyone, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, coffee lotus baked cheesecake. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Coffee Lotus baked Cheesecake is one of the most favored of recent trending foods in the world. It's enjoyed by millions every day. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. Coffee Lotus baked Cheesecake is something that I've loved my whole life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

To make the Lotus Biscoff cheesecake filling, place the cream cheese, Lotus Biscoff Spread (melted in the microwave), and caster into a large mixing bowl. Mix the ingredients with a wooden spoon or with an electric mixer, until they are all fully incorporated, do not over mix as this will create too much air in the mixture and will cause your cheesecake to crack when baked. The Lotus Biscoff Base for the Cheesecake: The base is a classic cheesecake base, but instead of the normal biscuits or cookies, we will make it with the lotus biscuits themselves.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have coffee lotus baked cheesecake using 11 ingredients and 9 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

In a small bowl mix together coffee granules and hot water until coffee is dissolved, we are making a very concentrated liquid to really give the cheesecake the coffee punch! Add the coffee mixture to cheesecake batter along with sour cream and vanilla mixing until just combined, scraping the sides to make sure fully incorporated. Use the tip of a knife to loosen the cheesecake from base of tin and then transfer cheesecake onto a platter using a cake lifter. In a pot, add in whipping cream and instant coffee. Heat on low and stir until the coffee is totally dissolved.
