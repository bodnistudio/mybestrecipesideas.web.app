All the standard taco salad fixings (ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes and onion) are chopped and tossed together with two kinds of cheese, purple kidney beans, Thousand Island dressing and a generous helping of corn chips to create a kaleidoscopic party-pleaser. My kids and husband ate their taco salad with the tortilla chips but I had mine with just lettuce tomatoes a tablespoon of reduced fat sour cream and homemade salsa. Heat taco shells according to package directions. Brown ground beef until fully cooked. Drain excess fat, then add taco seasoning, tomato paste, beans, and hot water.
