Store leftover rice in the fridge in an airtight container for up to one week. This time around I&#39;m excited to be making veg sushi rolls again for lunch on the road so I decided to prep the rice ahead. Make your own veggie sushi at home using &#39;rice&#39; made from cauliflower, to give this Japanese favourite a refreshing and healthy twist. I love veggie sushi and this recipe is extra delicious because it uses &#39;rice&#39; made from cauliflower instead of traditional rice, which works wonderfully in sushi.
