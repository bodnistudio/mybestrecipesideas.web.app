recipeinstructions:
- "There is a wide variety of Japanese curry base! Vermont has mild/med hot/hot. Java has mild/med hot/hot/spicy. Find your favorite curry base combination!"
- "You can get English label packages in the US! If you have access to Jungle Jim&#39;s in Cincinnati, OH, you&#39;ll find them in the Japanese section. Fukushinzuke pickles are stored near the tofu too!"
- "Peel the potatoes, carrots, and onions. Cut those and the beef into bite size pieces. *It will be better to cut the potatoes bigger since they tend to become smaller as it stews."
- "Soak potatoes in water for 10 mins to remove scum."
- "Stir-fry vegetables with oil."
- "Add beef and stir-fry again."
- "Add water little by little and stir gently."
- "Put in the bay leaves. They have an effect to reduce the meat smell."

- "Or... If you want to eat right away on the day you cooked, cool down once and then heat again. &#34;Stew → cool down &amp; rest → stew&#34; is the best method to make this curry richer. But, I would say 2nd day curry is much better!"
- "To cool it down quickly, soak the pan in a bigger pan with cold water. Change the water several times as it becomes warm."
- "Heat the curry to serve. Put rice in a bowl, pour curry, add Fukushinzuke pickles and done!"

Best Curry Rice in Tokyo Japanese curry is not like Indian or Southeast Asian curry - it&#39;s an entire genre in its own right. At its worst, it&#39;s thick, one-note, and too salty, like it came straight out of a store-bought curry roux mix. Here&#39;s which to use in recipes at home. This recipe captures a classic Japanese curry, complete with juicy pieces of chicken, tender nubbins of carrot, sweet peas, and silky chunks of potato, but it&#39;s seasoned with a homemade spice blend that&#39;s way better than what comes out of a tin.
