recipeinstructions:
- "I didn&#39;t include prep in the cooking time. That being said, I got the sauce ready a couple hours before hand and let it sit in the fridge. I think that really helps the flavor and the sauce is VERY important to this dish. I also set about 6 of the basil leaves out to dry a bit. Ok first step. The sauce!"
- "There&#39;s a neat trick to making a unique tomato sauce and it&#39;s perfect for this recipe. Cut your tomato in half so you have the top as one half and the bottom as the other. Now clean out all the crevices where the snotty textured slime is that holds the seeds. I just used the knife I cut the tomato with. Then use the spray nozzle on your sink to get it all nice n clean. Now, holding the exposed innards out, grate it like a piece of cheese. That&#39;s right, grate the tomato on a cheese grater. All the inner parts. You should be left with only the skin of the tomato. Do both halves of the tomato into a bowl. Dispose of the skins. Now add your spices, olive oil, balsamic and minced garlic. Stir well. Let sit in fridge for a couple hours."
- "Crumble your mozzarella into chunks. After that I drizzled a bit of olive oil onto them and sprinkled a bit of oregano. Now we build the pizza."
- "Spoon the sauce evenly over your pizza crust leaving about an inch on the edge. You should&#39;ve gotten the perfect amount from 1 large tomato.  Evenly distribute the mozzarella chunks. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Now tear up the 6 basil leaves you set aside earlier into smaller pieces and distribute them evenly. This is how mine looked pre oven."
- "Set a pizza pan on the middle rack and preheat the oven to 475. (If I had a pizza stone I would&#39;ve used that, but I don&#39;t). Slide the pizza onto the preheated pan and cook for 10 mins. Be careful not to burn yourself sliding the pizza in (I did haha)  Remove from oven. Place a full basil leaf on each slice, cut and enjoy. Like I said, I&#39;m a meat guy. I&#39;ve never tried this because there&#39;s no meat on it but MAN it was good! It&#39;s that sauce and fresh basil that does it. There are definitely more involved ways of making a margherita pizza but this is quick, easy and so so good."

##### Instructions to make Margherita Pizza:

1. I didn&#39;t include prep in the cooking time. That being said, I got the sauce ready a couple hours before hand and let it sit in the fridge. I think that really helps the flavor and the sauce is VERY important to this dish. I also set about 6 of the basil leaves out to dry a bit. Ok first step. The sauce!
1. There&#39;s a neat trick to making a unique tomato sauce and it&#39;s perfect for this recipe. - Cut your tomato in half so you have the top as one half and the bottom as the other. Now clean out all the crevices where the snotty textured slime is that holds the seeds. I just used the knife I cut the tomato with. Then use the spray nozzle on your sink to get it all nice n clean. - Now, holding the exposed innards out, grate it like a piece of cheese. That&#39;s right, grate the tomato on a cheese grater. All the inner parts. You should be left with only the skin of the tomato. Do both halves of the tomato into a bowl. Dispose of the skins. - Now add your spices, olive oil, balsamic and minced garlic. Stir well. Let sit in fridge for a couple hours.
1. Crumble your mozzarella into chunks. After that I drizzled a bit of olive oil onto them and sprinkled a bit of oregano. Now we build the pizza.
1. Spoon the sauce evenly over your pizza crust leaving about an inch on the edge. You should&#39;ve gotten the perfect amount from 1 large tomato.  - Evenly distribute the mozzarella chunks. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Now tear up the 6 basil leaves you set aside earlier into smaller pieces and distribute them evenly. This is how mine looked pre oven.
1. Set a pizza pan on the middle rack and preheat the oven to 475. (If I had a pizza stone I would&#39;ve used that, but I don&#39;t). Slide the pizza onto the preheated pan and cook for 10 mins. Be careful not to burn yourself sliding the pizza in (I did haha)  - Remove from oven. Place a full basil leaf on each slice, cut and enjoy. - Like I said, I&#39;m a meat guy.
