Made this last night and loved it. Now I did have to substitute but only because I didn&#39;t have breadcrumbs. Did have nacho chips so just ground them up. This taco meatloaf is the best of both worlds to me; a good hearty meatloaf but with a Mexican twist I love so much. James Beard Award-winning restaurant critic Brad A.
