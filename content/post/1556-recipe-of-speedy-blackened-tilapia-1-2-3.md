recipeingredient:
- "2 tilapia fillets about 4 oz each"
- "4 tsp your favorite blackened seasoning plus more if you want spicier for my seasoning recipe see step 2"
- "1/4 tsp salt optional"
- " olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "If your tilapia is frozen thaw for about 30 minutes in a flat dish of cold water (like a small casserole). When thawed, remove from water, Place on top of a small stack of paper towels to absorb excess water and gently pat tops dry."
- "Transfer tilapia to a clean, dry plate. Season both sides of both fillets with 1 tsp blackened season each, gently patting seasoning onto each side, use more or less as desired for more or less heat. Add a pinch of salt to each side before the seasoning, if desired (I personally don&#39;t use it for this recipe). Place in refrigerator and let sit 30 minutes to 1 hour. This part&#39;s important, just like a marinade.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/361433-blacken-your-soul-seasoning"
- "Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat (I use a 10&#34; skillet for two fillets). Add just enough oil to coat the bottom when you swirl the skillet around, usually about 2-3 tsp. Let oil heat for about 30 seconds. When oil is &#34;shimmering&#34; carefully add tilapia to the skillet. Cook 2-3 minutes per side. You will know when each side is done because it will &#34;release&#34; from the pan easily when you begin to slide a spatula underneath the fillet."
- "Serving suggestions: Serve with your favorite sides. Rice, mashed potatoes, steamed veggies are all good. I made my cauliflower &#34;risotto&#34; and roasted tomatoes with mushrooms for the picture shown.
