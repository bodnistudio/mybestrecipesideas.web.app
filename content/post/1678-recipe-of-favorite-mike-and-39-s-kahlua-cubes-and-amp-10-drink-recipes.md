Coffee liqueur is pretty easy to make at home, and if you&#39;ve read our guide on why instant coffee is a pantry essential, you know that we recommended the powdered stuff over fresh-brewed when making your own Kahlua at home.until now. Inspired by Los Angeles-based company Fliquor Bean, which cold brews coffee in a base of whiskey (yes, whiskey) rather than water, I made Kahlua the lazy way. Either milk or cream can be used in this cocktail, it just depends on how thick your prefer your creamy drinks. Keep in mind that it will dilute as the ice melts. Using an ice ball or large ice cubes will slow down the dilution.
