Grilled Honey Soy Salmon with Citrus Soba Noodles: I didn&#39;t have soba noodles on hand, so I used regular &#39;ol thin spaghetti noodles. In place of yuzu juice (hard to find), I used lemon juice. The book features traditional classics like shrimp wontonâ€¦and also modern takes on Asian food: Korean Grilled Steak Tacos with Kimchee Slaw: I used. Carefully add the shrimp to the wok and stir fry until the shrimp is pink.
