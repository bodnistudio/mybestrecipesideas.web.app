In a medium bowl, season beef with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. These guys are each stuffed with a cube of cheese and this time I used some spicy pepper-jack. This cheese worked perfect in the BBQ chicken bombs as I just love how well Monterey jack cheese melts. I smoked with apple wood and the sweeter fruit wood is a great choice for chicken meat. Apply a generous layer of BBQ sauce over the meat.
