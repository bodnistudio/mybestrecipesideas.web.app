Traditionally, shepherd&#39;s pie is made with lamb (hence the name). However, as the dish gained wider popularity outside of its native English homeland (where using beef would make this a cottage pie), beef became a common substitute, especially in America where it&#39;s more widely available than ground lamb. Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. So, this is how you spell it: Shepherd&#39;s Pie.
