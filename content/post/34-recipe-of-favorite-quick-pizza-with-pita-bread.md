Originally, my mom would use the big homemade pitas for the crust, but When I got married I didn&#39;t have the big homemade pitas. Years ago it was very hard to find pita bread in a supermarket, I had to get them at the Middle-Eastern grocery stores. Pizza only needs a few minutes to cook. In the Air Fryer and with Pita Bread, we need a lower temperature for a longer time to give the Pita a chance to warm up and not burn Air Fryers tend to cook quicker than ovens, I have found and different brands of Air Fryers cook different from each other.
