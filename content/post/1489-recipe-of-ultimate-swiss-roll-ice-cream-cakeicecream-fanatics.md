My own recipe calls for, what I call, a cold Genoise batter (whole eggs and sugar whipped, cake flour folded in). The colorful swirls of the Swiss roll make a vibrant, drool-worthy outside. And each slice reveals an even prettier ice cream filling inside. It&#39;s easy to make, it looks fancy, and it tastes like a fruit-filled summer day. A Swiss roll, jelly roll, roll cake, or cream roll, or Swiss log, is a type of sponge cake roll filled with whipped cream, jam, or icing.
