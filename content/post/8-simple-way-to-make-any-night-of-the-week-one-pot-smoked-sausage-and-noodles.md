Slice the sausage into one inch slices and then quarter the slices.. Using a pasta spoon I add them to the sausage skillet a little at a time, lifting the noodles out of the pot and draining a bit. It is ok if a little water gets in the skillet. Smoked sausage, creamed corn, sour cream and egg noodles are combined for an easy stovetop supper. Cook noodles according to package directions.; Cook and stir sausage, celery and onion in large saucepan over medium heat minutes, or until onion are crisp-tender.; Drain noodles.
