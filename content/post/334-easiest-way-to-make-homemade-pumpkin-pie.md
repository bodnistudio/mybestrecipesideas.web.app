<h3>Steps to make Pumpkin Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Cut the kabocha squash and remove the skin. Put the kabocha squash and one tablespoon each of water and sugar (not listed in ingredients) in a bowl. Cover with plastic film, and microwave for 5 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Mash with a rolling pin and strain through a sieve (optional)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Put the mixture in a pan, and add the sugar, butter and milk. Simmer over low heat until the mixture is thickened and slightly firm..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			I used casserole dishes for this recipe..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Roll out the puff pastry. Grease the dish with butter, and line the puff pastry snugly on the dish. Put the kabosha squash filling on top..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Decorate as you like. This is the most fun step! Apply water or beaten eggs to seal the dough tightly, otherwise the sealed part will open during baking..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Apply beaten eggs (not listed in ingredients) on the pie shell. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes at 200°C. If you prefer a less brown pie, bake it for 40 minutes at 180°C..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			It&#39;s done!!! Decorate with raisins if you have any, and the dish will look just like the original..
			
			
		</li>
