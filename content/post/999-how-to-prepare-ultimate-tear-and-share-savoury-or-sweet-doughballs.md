recipeingredient:
- " The dough"
- "3/4 lb 00 or bread flour"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "2 tsp granulated sugar"
- "1 packages easy yeast 7g"
- "2 tbsp olive oil extra virgin"
- "3/4 cup warm water"
- " Filling"
- "2 oz approx garlic butter"
- "30 slice chorizo or pepperoni"
- "1 mozzarella ball"
recipeinstructions:
- "This is my dough base, I always build upon this, adding more oil, salt, rosemary and garlic to make a focaccia: cheddar cheese and softened onion: sour dough starter instead of easy yeast, a little more oil and no proving to make ciabatta and of course pizza dough! (Add ¼ pound more flour and 1 egg, take out the sugar and yeast and you have perfect pasta dough)"
- "Add ingredients in the exact order I have listed, either into a well in the middle of the flour or into the bowl of a mixer with a dough hook."
- "When mixed together it should feel very SLIGHTLY sticky at first and become soft and pliant as you knead. Do not be tempted to add more flour immediately. If the dough doesn&#39;t form a soft ball after a couple of minutes kneading then lightly flour the work surface and continue kneading."
- "Knead for 10 minutes by hand or 5 minutes by machine. Cover and leave in a warm, but not hot, place for around 30 minutes. This recipe doesn&#39;t require the dough to double in size."
- "Preheat oven to 200º or Gas Mark 5"
- "Pinch off pieces of dough and roll between your palms to about 1 inch in diameter."
- "Flour your work surface very sparingly and roll out your balls of dough into an approximate circle slightly bigger than your slices of chorizo/salami/pepperoni/sausage/cheese or whatever you&#39;re using  (if you add another teaspoon of sugar to the dough, fill with a heap teaspoon of apple sauce (mixed with a sprinkle if cinnamon) and a teaspoon of thick custard roll up and brush the tops of the ring of doughballs with beaten egg then sprinkle with brown sugar and bake, you have a sweet tear and share)"
- "Using the tip of a rounded knife put some very small dabs of garlic butter (or ordinary butter) in the centre of the dough circle, then assemble your ingredients on top"
- "Gather the outside of the dough circle into the centre around the filling and pinch together to seal."
- "Place the finished doughballs on a prepared baking tray - I use the ring of a springform cake tin on a baking tray covered with greaseproof paper to create the tear and share. If there are too many to fit in the ring just place on the tray around the outside."
- "Place tray in centre of oven for 15 - 20 minutes until lightly browned."
- "Tear and share :)"
