##### The ingredients needed to make Vegetable pie before baking:

1. Take  Carrot make   cubes
1. Take  beans
1. Prepare  cauliflower
1. Get  Onion Make   cubes
1. Take  green chilli
1. Take  maida
1. Get  butter
1. Get  Milk
1. Take  egg
1. Prepare  capsicum
1. Get  tomato
1. Make ready  Bread crumbs    Little
1. Prepare  Mozzarella cheese


Watch the video above to see how I work through each of the following steps. Roll out the chilled pie dough: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the disks of chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator). Putting the pie that is ready for the oven on a hot cookie sheet helps liquefy the solid layers of fat in the pastry so the dough will become impermeable to the liquid in the pie filling. Before you start assembling the pie, put a cookie sheet in the oven.

##### Steps to make Vegetable pie before baking:

1. First cut vegetables in cubes and boil in water... Half boil ony put little salt.and strain in and keep aside. In a pan put butter and maida in a low flame add milk and stir it continually, if it become thick Â add egg mix it, add pepper also, in this white sauce add vegetables..in a pie dish pour it.decorste with the item which I mentioned. Preheat the oven in 180 Â degree for half an hour... Bake the upper part also.... It&#39;s ready ðŸ˜Š


Remove the cookie sheet from the oven (don&#39;t forget an oven mittâ€”it will be very hot!) and set the pie on it. Given that oven space is always at a premium on Thanksgiving, you&#39;ll need to plan your pie baking strategy ahead. Especially if you&#39;re doing the turkey, too, my suggestion is to bake the pie early in the day, before the turkey goes in. Cold butter is the key to a flaky pie crust (trust us), and it&#39;s probably a bit too warm after you&#39;ve rolled out the dough. For that reason, I don&#39;t like to egg-wash frozen-fruit pies, as that extra time in the oven can lead to excessive browning, even with a foil shield.
