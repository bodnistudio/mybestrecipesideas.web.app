Coconut milk adds mild sweetness and creaminess to the rice, while lime+cilantro transform the rice into a lively side that&#39;s an ideal accompaniment to any of your favorite. Rice Variety - I used Jasmine rice in this recipe but you can substitute with Basmati or long grain rice. Do not use short grain rice, such as risotto rice, as it is too sticky.
