- "5 large chicken breasts diced"

- "3-4 garlic cloves chopped"
- "3 tbsp fresh grated ginger"
- "2 tbsp turmeric"
- "2 tbsp hot chilli powder"
- "2 tbsp hot paprika"
- "1/2 tbsp ground cumin"
- "1 Kg passata"
- "800 ml coconut milk"

- "1 lime juiced"
- " Small bunch of coriander roughly chopped"
- "3 tbsp Greek yoghurt"
- " To serve"
- " Basmati rice"
- " Naan bread optional"
- " Greek yoghurt optional but encouraged"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by adding the butter and oil together in a large saucepan, and stir until sizzling"
- "Add the onion, garlic, ginger and a pinch of salt, and stir on a medium-low heat, until the onions are soft and brown. Top tip: Freeze your ginger, and grate it while it’s frozen. This makes it easier to grate - as when it isn’t frozen it’s all stringy."

- "Add the chicken, and bring the heat to a medium-high, and cook until the meat is white all over."
- "Add the potatoes then stir. Add the passata, coconut milk and chilli, then leave to simmer for around 45 mins, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are soft."
- "Add the lime and coriander, and stir. Once it’s finished, add the yoghurt to give the sauce a creamier texture."
- "Serve with fluffy basmati rice and Greek yoghurt."
