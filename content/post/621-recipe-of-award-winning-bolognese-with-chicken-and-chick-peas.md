Add tomatoes, wine, water, spinach and tomato paste to pan. This pasta with chicken, chickpeas and a tomato pumpkin coconut milk sauce is the perfect recipe for that. It only requires an onion, some garlic, a bit of oil (which I now know can be obtained from a can of tuna), chicken, pasta, pumpkin, tomato sauce and coconut milk. Salt and pepper (if you have it) will do for seasoning. Drain, and then combine with the chickpea bolognese sauce.
