This light and refreshing cold pasta salad is loaded with the flavors of the Mediterranean, and pairs well with grilled proteins, such as fish, pork, chicken or steak. If you make this in advance, reserve a bit of the dressing to add right before serving, as the pasta has a tendency to soak up the dressing as it sits over time. Chopped green pepper, onion, pimiento, corn, green beans, and green peas lend a flavorful. Make vinaigrette: In a jar fitted with a lid, combine olive.
