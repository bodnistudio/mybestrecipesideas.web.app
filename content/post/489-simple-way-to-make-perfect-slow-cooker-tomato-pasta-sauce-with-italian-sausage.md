recipeingredient:
- "12 oz. Italian Sausage links cut into 1inch pieces"
- "28 oz. canned tomatoes unsalted"
- "1 cup unsalted stock"
- "1 small onion chopped"
- "1/2 bell pepper cored and chopped"
- "1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "1-2 teaspoons dried oregano"
- "6 garlic cloves peeled and lightly crushed"
- "1/4 cup ketchup"
- "1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt to start"
- "1 teaspoon fish sauce"
- "1/4 teaspoon black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Throw all the ingredients into your slow cooker."
- "Give it all a few good stirs."
- "Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, or high for 4 to 5. It&#39;s a good idea to stir occasionally if you can to redistribute the seasonings. About 30 mins before you turn off the cooker is a good time to adjust seasonings so they can absorb - more salt if needed, maybe a pinch or two of sugar if your tomatoes are extra acidic, maybe a dash of Balsamic or extra Worcestershire if your tomatoes aren&#39;t tangy enough..."
- "A warning about high setting - it can get pretty hot depending on volume &amp; surface area. I have an 8.5 quart slow cooker, which means greater surface area and, as a result, a higher heat for the volume. At 4 hrs on high, I could smell the sugars from the tomatoes and ketchup going from caramelized to burnt on the sides. Less likely to happen if you have a smaller capacity cooker."
- "As a general rule, the lower the volume and/or the greater the surface area of the cooking vessel, the less the cook time. And there you have it. :)"
- "Enjoy with pasta of choice."
