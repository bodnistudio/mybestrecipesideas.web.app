Brush each sausage roll with the eggwash glaze. Sausage rolls are often part of the spread. A pleasantly spiced homemade sausage mixture is easy to make up with a pound or two of ground pork shoulder, not too lean. They are usually made with all-butter puff pastry (often frozen store-bought, a good option); these are wrapped in a very flaky lard and butter pastry. Add sausage; mix lightly but thoroughly.
