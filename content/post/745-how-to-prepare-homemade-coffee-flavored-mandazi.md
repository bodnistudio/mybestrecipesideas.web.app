Hey everyone, it is Drew, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, coffee flavored mandazi. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Coffee flavored mandazi is one of the most popular of current trending meals on earth. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It is easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. They're nice and they look wonderful. Coffee flavored mandazi is something which I've loved my whole life.

These amazingly soft triangle-shaped donuts are very famous in East Africa where I come from. They are excellent with a cup of tea or coffee. The dash of cardamom adds an authentic taste which makes it different from regular donuts.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook coffee flavored mandazi using 9 ingredients and 12 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

I have seen people ask whether yeast can be used in place of baking powder. This works but it is important to note that the flavor will be slightly different. &#34;I am surprised mandazi can be made without sugar.&#34; Rwandan mandazi are little African donuts that are truly addicting. Basically fried dough, one of my favorite things. These are typically made with less sugar than American style donuts, but they a have subtle flavor of coconut, cardamom and cinnamon.
