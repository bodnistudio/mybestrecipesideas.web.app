I used skim milk to coat the chicken pieces, instead of butter, before coating with the mixture, and I used the cooling racks on top of a cookie sheet to place the nuggets on, so they would be crisp on both sides. I have been working on developing a homemade chicken nugget recipe for years and tested countless versions. Baked chicken nuggets are low fat and healthier than fried. They are crisp on the outside and tender inside. If you want them a little larger, you&#39;ll get two dozen out of the recipe.
