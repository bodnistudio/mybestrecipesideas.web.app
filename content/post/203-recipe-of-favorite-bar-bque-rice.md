Chuck Ozburn sent in this fantastic, classic-style Carolina barbecue rub recipe. It&#39;s perfect for pork because it&#39;s a well-balanced rub that goes light on the salt and spice, with just a touch of sweetness from white and brown sugar. Try this rub next time you want to make a traditional Carolina Pulled Pork, or experiment and use it on chicken or turkey breast. Sprinkle with seasoned salt and garlic powder.
