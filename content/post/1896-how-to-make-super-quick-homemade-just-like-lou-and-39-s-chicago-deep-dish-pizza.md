Have been to most all the Chicago pizza places except Lou Malnati&#39;s. Craving a taste of home, I heard their pizza is the best so I thought I&#39;d give it a try. Maybe so if I ate it there but the frozen pizza I received is not as tasty as I hoped it would be. Nothing says &#34;Chicago&#34; like deep dish pizza, and nothing says deep dish pizza like Lou Malnati&#39;s.
