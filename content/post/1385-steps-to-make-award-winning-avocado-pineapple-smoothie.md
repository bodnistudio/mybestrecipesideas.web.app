This one tastes sweet like pineapple and creamy like ice cream (thanks to the avocado). Make sure you go for a ripe, sweet pineapple. Since there&#39;s only half a banana in this smoothie, you&#39;re relying on the pineapple to sweeten up the savoury effect of the kale and avocado. I finished off this Pineapple Avocado Detox Smoothie with some almonds and chia seeds - to give it an extra nutritional punch. Hot, humid days call for refreshing frozen treats, am I right?
