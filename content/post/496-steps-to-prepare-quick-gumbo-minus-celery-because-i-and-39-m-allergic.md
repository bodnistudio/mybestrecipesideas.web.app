My whole family liked it, but I think the spirit of gumbo calls for you to create your own version, so feel free to mess with my recipe at will! So, I continue to carry my epi pens and avoid all celery. If you have a shellfish allergy, you&#39;ll need to be extremely careful when dining out. You may want to avoid seafood restaurants entirely since people with severe shellfish allergies have had allergic reactions simply from breathing in particles of allergens from shellfish that is being steamed, fried, or boiled.

Gumbo file powder or sliced okra are what I use if the gumbo is too thin for your preference at the final boil. Otherwise, as mentioned, more flour when making the roux. I&#39;ve also used corn starch whisked into cold seafood/chicken stock and then slowly poured/whisked into the boiling final gumbo stock. I have a legitimate complaint, do not have access to the Internet because I&#39;m a senior and am having to ask my daughter to log a complaint because there is no venue for me to do so. I should not be charged to give my opinion on the quality of the Campbell&#39;s Soup at Campbell&#39;s nor should I have had to waste my money on the bad-tasting soup.
