<h3>Steps to make Pumpkin Torte:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			In a large mixing bowl,  mix together cake mix,  pumpkin,  milk, eggs,  butter,  and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Beat for 2 minutes.  Pour into two greased and floured 9-inch cake pans..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake at 350Â° for 20-25 minutes.  Cool for ten minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely. I try and bake my cakes the day before,  after completely cooled I store in refrigerator until the next day,  chilling makes cutting easier..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl until fluffy.  Add confectioners sugar and remaining pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice and beat until smooth. Fold in whipped topping..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cut each cake horizontally into two layers.  A long serrated bread knife works well.  Place bottom layer on a plate,  spread 1/4 of the filling. Repeat until all layers are finished. Drizzle with caramel topping  and sprinkle with pecans. Store in refrigerator..
