##### The ingredients needed to make Steak pinwheels:

1. Make ready 1 lb sirloin tip steak
1. Get 2 cups freshly shredded Parmesan cheese
1. Get 1/4 cup diced fresh cilantro
1. Take 1 tsp onion powder
1. Prepare 2 tbs Worcester sauce
1. Take 1 tsp Italian seasoning
1. Take 1 tsp meat tenderizer
1. Prepare 3 tbs olive oil
1. Make ready 1 box beef broth


This recipe uses a less expensive but flavorful cut of beef to form single-serving pinwheels stuffed with Parmesan and parsley, and a boost of flavor from garlic, rosemary and lemon. A skirt steak is ideal to use because it is already thin and long enough to roll like a jellyroll. According to The Beef Checkoff, significant research shows that some people can lose and/or maintain a healthy weight, support a healthy metabolism, and age more vibrantly when they consume more high-quality protein, within calorie goals. Beef - Sirloin butterflied and pounded out thin is an excellent substitute.

Ask your butcher if they have thin cut pieces to save some time. Pesto - A nice thick pesto or just a whole bunch of basil leaves gives nice color and flavor to these flank steak rolls. Prosciutto and provolone - Alternatives such as mortadella, ham and mozzarella work. Starting at the short ends, roll each skirt steak into a pinwheel. Flank steak is one of those items I keep in stock in the deep freezer since its so fast to cook, inexpensive and versatile.
