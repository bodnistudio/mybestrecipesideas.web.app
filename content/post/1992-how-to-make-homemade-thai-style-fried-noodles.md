Add rice noodles and toss/stir well then add sugar, fish sauce and tamarind with a little water - stir well. In fact, its name literally means &#34;Thai-style stir-fried noodles,&#34; and for a dish to be so named in its own country clearly suggests an origin that isn&#39;t Thai. Indeed, noodle cookery in most Southeast Asian countries was introduced by the wave of immigrants from southern China settling in the region the past century.
