The recipe stuck, and eventually people started making rice-filled meatballs by choice rather than necessity. Porcupine Meatballs originated during the Great Depression, when rice was affordable and readily available, but meat was pricey. By adding rice to a classic meatball recipe, home cooks could bulk up the meal and stretch a small amount of beef a little bit further. Crush cereal. (To easily crush cereal, place in plastic bag or between sheets of waxed paper, and crush with rolling pin.) In large bowl, mix crushed cereal, beef, rice, milk, dry soup mix and egg.
