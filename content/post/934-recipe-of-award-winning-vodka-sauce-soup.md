A piece of advice: use the best vodka you can - it really makes a big difference! Serve with pasta, and garnish with grated Parmesan cheese. Pasta alla vodka was never part of my Italian-American-restaurant repertoire as a kid â€” I&#39;d go for the aglio e olio instead (or, if given the opportunity, a cheese calzone with a dish of marinara for dunking). As an adult, though, vodka sauce speaks to me: creamy, spicy, tomatoey, and a bump up from macaroni and cheese and arguably easier to make.

Penne Alla Vodka - perfectly hearty and tender penne pasta is tossed with a creamy and vibrant, San Marzano tomato based and vodka infused sauce that&#39;s seasoned with fresh herbs and parmesan. Other classic Italian-American favorites to add to the dinner rotation include Pasta Primavera, Alfredo Sauce, easy Spaghetti Sauce, and the best Meatball recipe! One of my personal favorite ways to serve vodka sauce is simply swapping it in some of our favorite recipes where it calls for a pasta sauce.
