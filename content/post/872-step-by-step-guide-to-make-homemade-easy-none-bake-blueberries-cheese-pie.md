<h3>Steps to make Easy None-bake Blueberries Cheese Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Ground your cracker before mix well with icing and butter. Then cover on 9-inches pie platter. The crust should be solidly, 1 centimeter thick and the border should be 1 inche tall..

		<li>
			You can cheat by using Ready crust. Last time I made this, Keebler&#39;s Ready crust was used and my life was a little easier..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Let cream cheese melt without microwave but if you are not in tropical country and the weather can&#39;t help, use the lowest heat that you microwave produces you. Stir it well before gently add condensed milk..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			The mixture should be stirred well before add lemon juice. Well, I were told that after lemon juice was added, the mixture must not be stirred too much unless the cream cheese won&#39;t stick together. Then fill the mixture into the crust..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Leave the pie in refrigerator for a while. Don&#39;t let your younger sister puts her fingers for tasting. Cover with blueberries filling before served..
