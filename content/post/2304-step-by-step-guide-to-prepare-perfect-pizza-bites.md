I missed an important direction but these still came out delicious!. Pepperoni Pizza Bites are a cross between a bagel bite and a pizza muffin. Still chewy and savory, but with a softer texture than the prepackaged frozen variety. Place each pizza dough triangle into each mini muffin cup, leaving the two ends of the triangle sticking out (these will help you pull out the pizza bites easier after baking). Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a medium saucepot.
