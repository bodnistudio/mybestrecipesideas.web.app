		Just looking at a lemon meringue pie make your mouth water as you think of summer picnics.
	
		Now you can think of heaping meringue on all sorts of pies, from sour-cream/raisin to key lime to chocolate pudding.
	
		This pie is best served the day it&#39;s made.
	
		Unlike most lemon meringue pie recipes, which can be rife with issues — a soggy crust, a soupy filling, or a meringue that weeps — Myra&#39;s recipe is foolproof.
	
		It&#39;s good too: I made one this past weekend and left it on the counter with a note for my husband and kids to try it.
