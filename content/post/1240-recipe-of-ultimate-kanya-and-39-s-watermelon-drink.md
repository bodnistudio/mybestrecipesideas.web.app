So funny, not so funny story about this cocktail. I got the idea from a friend. But instead of pouring the rum in the watermelon I cut the melon into bite sized chunks and marinated it overnight in Pineapple flavored rum. I then made a punch out of Melon Verdi &amp; Ginger ale and drained the rum off the watermelon and added the melon to the punch.

It was the best summer drink we ever had. Fresh watermelon calls for a super fresh cocktail and it doesn&#39;t get much fresher than the mojito. It&#39;s one of the best drinks of summer and it&#39;s just a little better with some juicy melon. The Independence Day mojito is very simple. The only real change from the original mojito recipe is the addition of watermelon cubes and raspberries.
