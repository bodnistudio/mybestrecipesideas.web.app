<h3>Instructions to make Perfect 3-2-1 Pie Crust:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Cut butter into 1/2&#34; cubes, placing them on a plate in the freezer for about 5 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a large bowl, lightly knead together flour, butter cubes, and coconut oil with your hands. Do not overwork the dough, as it is necessary to keep the butter and coconut oil as solid and cold as possible. If at any point the fats start to melt, immediately place dough in the freezer until cold, then work in a small handful of flour and try again..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla, and knead lightly..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add ice water a tablespoon at a time, gently incorporating it into the dough until it has a firm, but slightly malleable consistency..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Form a ball with the dough and wrap it in plastic wrap. Place in freezer for 20 minutes. Do not rush this process. Wait it out..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Lightly flour a countertop and remove dough from freezer and plastic wrap..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Divide dough in half. One half will be the bottom crust, the other will be your lattice top. With a rolling pin, separately roll each half to about 1/4&#34; thick, and roughly 12&#34; in diameter..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place one of your two halves into an ungreased 9&#34; pie pan, trimming the overage with a knife. Crimp edges of crust against the lip of the pie pan with a fork..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cut the other half into 3/4&#34; strips. Once you fill your pie with whatever filling you like, lay these strips across the top of your pie and brush with an egg yolk and coarse sugar if desired. Cooking time and temperature depends on the exact filling of your pie, but is generally 350Â° for 45-50 minutes for fruit pies..
