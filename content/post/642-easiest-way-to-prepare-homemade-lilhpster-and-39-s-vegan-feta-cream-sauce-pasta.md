Thank you so much I am sure my pasta will be much enjoyed. Many thanks and keep safe, from Lara x HOW TO MAKE GARLIC BUTTER SAUCE FOR PASTA Making a sauce for pasta doesn&#39;t get much easier than this! Bring a large pot of water to a boil. I pureed mine in the blender as I prefer smooth creamy sauces, and I added three garlic cloves as I love garlic. The base for the vegan alfredo sauce starts with creating a roux, which is achieved with olive oil, garlic, and either arrowroot powder or all-purpose flour (if not GF).
