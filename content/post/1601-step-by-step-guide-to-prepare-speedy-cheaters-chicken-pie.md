Once done remove chicken and carrots and set aside. strain stock and reserve..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Quarter and sauté the mushrooms in butter or olive oil over medium heat until lightly browned, approx 7 minutes.  mix soups and fill one can with reserved stock and combine until smooth.  Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, cut in to bite sized pieces or shred. add chicken,  carrots,  peas, sautéed mushrooms, drained potatoes and seasonings to soup mixture and stir to thoroughly combine.  place chicken mixture in unbaked pie shell then cover with uncooked pastry sheet. make sure to crimp the edges together well so there are no leaks.  in a small bowl beat egg and brush over the entire top of pastry. cut three or four small slits into the top to release the steam. bake in a preheated 400° oven for approximately 45 minutes until golden brown. watch the edges of the crust so they don&#39;t burn. once baked,  let stand at least 5 minutes before cutting..
