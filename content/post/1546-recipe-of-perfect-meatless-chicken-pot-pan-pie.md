<h3>Steps to make Meatless chicken pot pan pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Boil rice, add cream of chicken to rice when it&#39;s done cooking. Turn heat down to medium..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Empty canned vegetables into a strainer, and rinse with cold water. Pour into a separate pot from the rice, and heat on medium-high. Chop onion into the mixed veggies. Pour 1/5 cup oil in with the veggies, and stir occasionally..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add garlic to the rice and stir. I added paprika and parsley, and some cumin. But season as you see fit. Turn off your pots, add the cheese to the rice and chicken soup..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Serve with the veggies on the bottom, and the rice over it..
			
			
		</li>
	
</ol>

		Stir until the chicken is well coated with flour.
	
		Slowly pour in the milk, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook for five minutes or until slightly thickened.
