Hey everyone, it's Drew, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, watermelon drink. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

This easy drink is simply fresh, juicy watermelon + ice cubes + a touch of honey. Just remember: When you blend the watermelon, you&#39;ll end up with about half the amount of juice (eight cups of watermelon in the Watermelon Margarita Mocktails will blend down to about four cups of juice.) Watermelon brings natural sweetness and adds a pop of color to any drink. These alcoholic and non-alcoholic watermelon drinks are great for using up leftover fruit you have on hand.

Watermelon Drink is one of the most well liked of current trending meals on earth. It's appreciated by millions daily. It is easy, it's quick, it tastes delicious. They're nice and they look wonderful. Watermelon Drink is something that I've loved my entire life.

Fresh watermelon calls for a super fresh cocktail and it doesn&#39;t get much fresher than the mojito. It&#39;s one of the best drinks of summer and it&#39;s just a little better with some juicy melon. The Independence Day mojito is very simple. The only real change from the original mojito recipe is the addition of watermelon cubes and raspberries.
