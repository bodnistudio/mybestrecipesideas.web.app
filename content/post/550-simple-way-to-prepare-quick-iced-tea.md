1. Prepare  tea
1. Prepare  mint leaves

Use filtered tap water or spring water, if possible. When it comes to the tea itself, we&#39;ve found that loose-leaf tea produces a fuller-bodied tea, but tea bags will work in. Strong black teas are the traditional base for iced tea, but feel free to experiment. It&#39;s amazing what a tea bag can do.
