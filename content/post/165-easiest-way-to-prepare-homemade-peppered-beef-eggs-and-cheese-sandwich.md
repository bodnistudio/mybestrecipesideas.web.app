Our Lenten dishes many times included eggs as a substitute for meat or poultry. I loved making an egg, pepper and tomato scramble and I agree with you about needing fresh ingredients and good Parmesan Reggiano cheese. Your sandwich is similiar except for the addition of fresh tomatoes. This pepper and egg sandwich is simply (and satisfyingly) scrambled eggs along with sweet bell peppers and onions and stuffed into bread.

An Italian American staple perfect for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in between. This was a very good sandwich, much different than the sparse examples of pepper and egg sandwiches I&#39;d experienced previously. The eggs could have been seasoned a bit better, and I probably should have tried it with giardiniera (the bottle of hot sauce on the table helped on both counts), but the bread was crisp-crusted with a light crumb and the eggs were hot and fluffy. Put meat on a sub bun and top with onion and green pepper and Swiss or provolone cheese on top of that. Leave open-faced and broil until the cheese just starts to brown.
