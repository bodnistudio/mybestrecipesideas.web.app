I hope you consider trying it! Do not over mix but whisk until smooth consistency. This recipe takes a lot of effort, but it&#39;s well worth it. I always have requests for it and it won over my now husband. I&#39;ve often used only the cake recipe and have used other simpler frosting to make into a peanut butter or chocolate candy cane cake as I don&#39;t always have luck with the frosting setting correctly (though people still compliment the flavor).
