Doing some research into Steak Diane, I found that the &#34;Diane&#34; part refers to Diana, the Greco-Roman goddess of the hunt, and &#34;a la Diane&#34; sauces were typically served with venison and game meat in centuries past. It was probably New York hotels that popularized the flambéed steak version. Steak Diane was a staple on menus in fine dining establishments back in the day. Prepared tableside where the server ignited the cognac, it was an impressive sight. You don&#39;t need to flame the cognac; just keeping it on the heat will eventually evaporate the alcohol.
