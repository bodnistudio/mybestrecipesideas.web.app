recipeingredient:
- "2 average sized ripe bananas"
- "1 tbsp cocoa powder plus extra to taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make sure to prepare ahead of time as you will need to freeze bananas. Most freezers will take between 3 and 4 hours."
- "Starting off, peel your bananas and cut into slices approximately half a centimeter thick."
- "Place banana slices into a gallon size freezer bag and arrange them so they lay separate from each other, flat inside the bag."
- "Freeze bananas."
- "Once the bananas are frozen solid, remove them from the freezer and let them sit out and thaw slightly - enough to allow you to pinch them and break them in half. About 10 minutes."
- "Once bananas have thawed, dump them into the blender. Add cocoa powder (or any other flavor), and blend until smooth. You may have to pause and stir so that clumps reach the bottom."
- "Serve, and eat immediately. Enjoy!"
- "You do not have to use cocoa powder, however it is by far my favorite flavor ;). You may also throw in a handful of berries or other fruit, a tsp of vanilla extract, flavored jam or jelly, nuts, marshmallow cream (don&#39;t use regular marshmallows!), coconut, or whatever flavor you like. Try not to use watery fruit like watermelon or cantaloupe as they will make the ice cream runny. If you use smaller sized bananas, use three or four for one serving."
