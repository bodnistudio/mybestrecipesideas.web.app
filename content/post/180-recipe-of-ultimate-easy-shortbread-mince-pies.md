- "Pinch salt"
- "280 g10oz mincemeat"

recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, add the cold diced butter to the sifted flour."
- "To make the pastry, rub together with your fingers until combined. Then mix in 100g golden caster sugar and a pinch of salt."
- "Combine the pastry into a ball – don’t add liquid – and knead it briefly. The dough will be fairly firm, like shortbread dough. You can use the dough immediately, or chill for later."

- "Beat 1 small egg and brush the tops of the pies."
- "Bake for 20 mins until golden. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 mins, then remove to a wire rack."
