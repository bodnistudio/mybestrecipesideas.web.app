In a large bowl, combine pineapple, apples, grapes and poppy seeds. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly while adding pineapple juice gradually. To give this salad a little extra flare, I added some chopped pineapple to give it a hint of sweetness in every bite. Boy, was that a good decision. There really is nothing better than juicy pineapple in the summer, except for maybe a bite of pineapple mixed with three types of beans and veggies.
