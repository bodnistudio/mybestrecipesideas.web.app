<h3>Instructions to make My Shepherd&#39;s pie:</h3>

		<li>
			* i only use about a 1/4 of the can of beans and corn* Dice onions and mince garlic. Dice green beans into 1/4&#34; bits. Mince garlic.  Saute onions in a tablespoon of olive oil until starting to turn transparent. Then add beans, garlic and corn. Season with salt and pepper.  Cook approx 5 mins..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			When veggies are done put in a bowl or plate to the side. Then start cooking turkey meat in same pan. Ground it up kinda like you would do a taco meat or chili. Cook fully. Then drain any fat..

		<li>
			Throw veggies and meat back into pan. Add the 1/4 cup of beef broth and a good couple of squirts of Worcestershire sauce.  Saute until the broth has been reduced a touch. About 5 to 7 mins. Taste to see if it needs salt and pepper. Turn off heat. Place to side..

		<li>
			Boil a pot of  water. Peel and cube potatoes.  When fork tender. Drain water.  Save a nice helping handful of cheese for topping.  In bowl add potatoes, milk butter, cheddar cheese, salt and pepper.  Mash the way you like your mash potatoes.  I use a hand masher cause I like mine kinda thick..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pour meat and veggies into a corningware or Pyrex oven safe bowl or deep pan. Whatever you got that&#39;s deep.  Then top with potatoes.  Spread evenly so all the meat is covered.  Then top off with extra cheese..
