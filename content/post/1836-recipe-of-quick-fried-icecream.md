1. Take 4 slice bread
1. Get 2 scoops icecream

So we opted to skip it. Instead, we coat ice cream in buttery, crunchy corn flakes that gets toasted separately so they taste fried without the drama. Fried Ice Cream Dessert is one of my favorite desserts ever! There&#39;s no deep-frying involved with this version, just a quick pan-fry to make the amazing crust that coats a dreamy, cinnamon ice cream.
