Whip it up (I just used a fork and didn&#39;t bust out the electric mixer, but sure that works too) and spread on the cupcakes - will intensify the tasty coconut flavor even more. Line two cupcake pans with paper liners. Lightly spray the top of the pans with a nonstick cooking spray with flour, such as Baker&#39;s Joy or Pam Baking Spray with Flour, just in case the cupcake tops stick to the pan (don&#39;t worry if the spray gets in the liners). In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
