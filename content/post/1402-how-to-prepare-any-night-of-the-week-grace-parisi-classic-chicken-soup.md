I love this recipe because it makes use of the entire chicken carcass in the soup, which adds an incredible amount of flavor (as it should) to chicken soup. Beginning with a Fast Chicken Soup Base using store bought chicken, it is easy to knock hours off of the cooking time usually needed for homemade chicken and rice soup and still end up with soup that tastes even better than the &#39;from scratch&#39; method. This chicken noodle soup recipe is about as classic as they come. I&#39;ve never made chicken noodle soup completely from scratch before and after making this, I&#39;m never going back!
