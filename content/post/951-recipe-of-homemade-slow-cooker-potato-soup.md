recipeingredient:
- "5 lb potatoes scrubbed and diced to 1in pieces"
- "1 cup carrot raw and finely diced"
- "1 cup celery finely diced"
- "1 tbsp onion powder"
- "1 1/2 tsp garlic powder"
- "8 cup chicken stock"
- "2 1/2 lb diced ham or smoked pork picnic shoulder bought precooked"
- "1 can evaporated milk 12oz"
- "2 cup dried potato flakes instant mashed potatoes"
- "1 packages cream cheese 8oz softened"
- "1 salt and pepper to taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add all ingredients except cream cheese, milk, and potato flakes to 7 qt crockpot. Cook on HIGH 4-5 hours until potatoes are fork tender. Add cream cheese, milk, and potato flakes. Stir to combine CAREFULLY , crock pot will be VERY FULL.  Taste soup and add desired salt and pepper. Put lid back on pot and continue to cook on high for 20-30 minutes (this ensures the cream cheese breaks down completely). Stir and serve."
- "Notes : Easy with the salt as both the stock and ham will already be full of sodium.  Potato flakes can be adjusted for desired consistancy. No, you don&#39;t peel the potatoes. To keep left overs and serve again, cool crock pot down at room temp and put in fridge overnight, an hour before serving heat on low. Do NOT  leave on warm overnight or you&#39;ll just have a goopy pot of mashed potatoes."
