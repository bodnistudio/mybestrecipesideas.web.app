recipeinstructions:
- "Break the coconut into pieces with a hammer andÂ pry out the coconutÂ meat from the shell.  Wash the coconut meat andÂ cut into tiny pieces. Place in a blender, add a small quantity ofÂ Warm water (just enough to allow the blender blades to rotate freely) andÂ grind into a smooth paste.You can also use a grater for this purpose. But a blender is more efficient. Pour the mixture of coconut milk and chaff into a sieve with tiny holes so that none of the chaff gets through."
- "Use hands toÂ squeeze outÂ as much milk from the chaff as possible. If you feel that there is more milk in the chaff, place the chaff in a bowl andÂ add more warm water. squeeze It till the milk that comes out becomes too pale. Remember that the coconut milk will later be used in cooking the rice so if the water becomes too much, the rice will be overcooked. This is not what we want so add water sparingly."
- "Place a pot on medium heat, add in the coconut milk, water, salt, curry, thyme, bay leaves and 2 maggi cubes."
- "Cover the pot until the mixture comes to a rolling boil.  Add in washed rice.  Simmer on low-medium heat until rice is cooked and there is no more liquid in the rice. Set aside to cool completely"
- "In a large pan, heat up the oil.  Add in the chopped onions, hot dogs, pepper flakes, maggi and diced vegetable."
- "Stir fry for 2- 3 minutes.  Taste and adjust for seasoning.  Pour in already cooked rice.  Taste and adjust for seasoning. Stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes. Your delicious coconut fried rice is ready ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹"
- "Enjoy with your sauced beef, chicken, turkey or fish alongside fried plantain."
- "For your sauced beef. Season with curry, thyme, a pinch of salt and seasoning cube and little water. Set on fire and cook till tender. Then Blend your tomatoes and pepper, place a pot on fire, add chopped onion and pepper mix. Stir fry for about 5 to ten minutes. Add any seasoning of your choice and a pinch of salt.
