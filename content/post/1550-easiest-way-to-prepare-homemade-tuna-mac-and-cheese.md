recipeingredient:
- "2 cups whole wheat egg noodles"
- "2 tbsp. unsalted butter"
- "1/4 yellow onion finely diced"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "2 tbsp. all purpose flour"
- "3/4 cup unsalted chicken broth"

- "3/4 cup freshly shredded cheese of choice"
- "1 can (5 oz.) unsalted solid albacore tuna drained"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the egg noodles in a large pot of salted boiling water according to package directions. Once it&#39;s done, drain it and toss it lightly with olive oil to prevent it from sticking. Set it aside. In the same pot, heat the butter over medium heat. Once it&#39;s melted, add the onion and cook until it&#39;s translucent, just about 3-4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook just until fragrant."
- "Stir in the flour and cook, stirring fairly constantly for a couple more minutes. Then slowly add in the broth and the milk while stirring to fully incorporate everything smoothly. Increase the heat to med-high. Let it come up to a low boil."
- "Once it&#39;s bubbling, lower the heat back down and let it simmer until it&#39;s thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Then stir in the salt, pepper and peas. Slightly break up the tuna with a fork into large chunks and stir that in as well. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese until it&#39;s melted in, then serve."
