Lebanese coffee is traditionally strong and black and is similar to the coffee of other Middle Eastern countries. The coffee pot has to be &#34;oriental&#34; meaning conical, larger at its base and narrower from top. This is a mandatory requirement for the foam or &#34;achoueh&#34; to form at the coffee&#39;s surface. Be aware that a Lebanese coffee with no &#34;achoueh&#34; is not a Lebanese coffee !!
