recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll out the pastry on a lightly floured work surface to a 28cm diameter circle, taking care not to overwork the dough or it will become too soft. Roll the pastry around the rolling pin and ease into a 24cm fluted loose-base round tart (flan) tin, pressing it into the base and side with your fingertips."
- "Roll the pin over the tin to trim the excess pastry. Line the pastry with non-stick baking paper and fill with baking beads or uncooked rice. Bake for 20 minutes, and then remove the paper and weights. Reduce oven temperature to 160°C (320°F)."
- "Put the butter, sugar, golden syrup, vanilla essence and egg in a bowl and whisk until well combined. Scatter the pecan nuts evenly over the pastry shell and pour in the syrup mixture. Bake for 40 minutes or until the filling is browned and firm to touch. Place on a rack and cool in the tin."
- "Put the jam in a small saucepan and heat until warm. Push through a sieve to remove any solids. Brush the sieved jam over the top of the pie to glaze."
