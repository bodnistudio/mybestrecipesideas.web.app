		People who have eaten sweet potato pie all their lives say this recipe is the best they have ever tasted.
	
		Crisp, baked sweet potato rounds piled high with spicy hummus, black bean and corn salsa, cilantro and jalapeños.
	
		Roasting the potatoes does slow down the process, so I recommend roasting extra sweet potatoes one night for dinner and using the left overs for this recipe the next day.
	
		Sweet potato hummus recipe made in a food processor.
	
		Perfect for dipping veggies and pita chips, or as a sandwich spread.
