recipeingredient:
- "1 cup breadcrumbs I actually used stale bread that was kickin around and grated it to crumbs"
- "2 eggs beaten"
- "1 tbsp herb seasoning mix"
- "1 tsp fresh thyme"

- "1 1/2 cup finely chopped cabbage"
- "1/2 onion chopped"

- "1 tsp salt"
- " ground black pepper"
- " chili flakes"

recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the potato and grate using a hand grater or food processor with a grater attachment. Immediately place in a colinder and squeeze the liquid out of it. Let rest a few minutes."
- "In a mixing bowl, add bread crumbs, herbs, and the beaten eggs. Give the potato another squeeze and try to get as much liquid as you can out of it and then add to the bread crumb mixture. Mix with your hands to combine."
- "Finely chop cabbage and onion and add to the potato mixture. Also add minced garlic, generously salt and pepper, thyme, and chili flakes. Mix with hands to combine. Mixture should be wet but still hold together when squeezed. Depending on if you put more potatoes and cabbage, you may need more bread crumbs or herbs and spices."
- "Do a trial run to test them out. Heat a bit of vegetable oil on medium-low and spoon about a teaspoon sized pancake and brown on both sides. If it needs more chili pepper, salt or pepper, more bread crumbs, or anything else, add it now. I decided mine needed more chili flakes, thyme, and pepper."
- "When they are to your liking, generously coat the saute pan with vegetable oil, turn up to medium, and spoon 1/4 cup sized pancakes into pan. Flatten a bit with a spatula, and cook about 2-3 minutes or until golden brown on each side. Don&#39;t crowd the pan - they won&#39;t cook right if you do. You&#39;ll have to babysit these.. They can overcook or undercook fairly easily."
- "Remove pancakes when done cooking to a plate with a paper towel."
- "These are fantastic on their own but a little sour cream, or hot sauce, or applesauce never hurts! Enjoy!"
- "Note: measurements are approximate.. &#34;give or take&#34; depending on how much potato and cabbage you use and to your liking."
