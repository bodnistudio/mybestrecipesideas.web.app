- "Mix brown sugar, dry mustard, paprika, salt and pepper, dry dill and crushed red pepper flakes."
- "Brush wet mix generously over all sides of steaks being sure to use all of it. Season with dry mix on all sides. I wore a glove and patted the seasoning in, however, I did not use all of the seasoning. But I do like bold flavors!"
