recipeinstructions:
- "This is the most &#34;difficult&#34; and boring part of the preparation. You&#39;ll need a potato peeler and you have to peel each carrot (and/or zucchini) until it&#39;s so thin that you can&#39;t possibly peel it anymore. The time this takes depends on the size of the carrots but it&#39;s generally ~6 mins per carrot."
- "Once you&#39;re done with step one you&#39;ll have carrot (and/or zucchini) noodles! They may seem like a lot but they&#39;ll shrink in size later on."
- "Throw all of the &#34;noodles&#34; into a frying pan and cook for ~3-5 mins, until they&#39;re as soft as you like your pasta to be. You don&#39;t need to add any oil but you gotta stir and move them around a lot."
- "Turn off the heat and add your favorite sauce (that you&#39;ve already prepared before starting with this recipe)."
- "Transfer to bowls."
- "Top with a generous amount of grated cheese (I find that the taste of the carrots is too strong without cheese) and enjoy!"
