RECIPE UPDATE I&#39;m the author of this recipe and I wanted to make a few updates. I now use cumin instead of the black pepper. To adjust the texture between creamy and more solid (which is very good also) vary the amount of liquid you drain from the can. This granola recipe is also a far more healthy granola option, since it&#39;s made with whole grains, unrefined oil and naturally sweetened.
