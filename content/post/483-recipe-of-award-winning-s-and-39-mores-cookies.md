- "10 graham cracker sheets"
- "1 cup flour"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1/2 cup butter softened"
- "2/3 cup light brown sugar"
- "1/3 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 egg"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "5 cup mini marshmallows"
- "3/4 cup milk chocolate chips"
- "3 tbsp butter"
- "1 tbsp water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350."
- "Put graham crackers in a food processor until finely ground (they should be basically a powder so they blend in with the flour)."
- "Combine ground graham crackers, flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside."
- "Using an electric mixer, blend the 1/2 cup butter with both brown and granulated sugar until light and fluffy."
- "Add egg and vanilla to sugar mixture. Slowly add dry ingredients and blend until well combined."

- "Bake cookies for 9 minutes and allow them to cool."
- "Set broiler to high."
- "To make the marshmallows, I tried two different ways. The first is to arrange marshmallows on individual cookies, closely packed together and then to broil the cookies whole until the tops are browned. This method makes them turn out prettier, but is probably more tedious and and you have to make sure the broiler doesn&#39;t burn your cookies."
- "The second way of making marshmallows is to generously butter a cookie sheet and closely pack individual marshmallows on it in a single layer. Broil the whole cookie sheet about 45 seconds until they start to turn brown. If your use this method, make sure you move onto the next step quickly (before the marshmallows cool and get harder and stickier)."
- "Use a metal spatula to scoop the marshmallows from the cookie sheet to the cookies. You might have to lift the marshmallows with the spatula and put the cookies underneath and scoop up some marshmallows with your cookies."
- "Microwave chocolate chips, 3 Tbsp butter, and water, stirring every 20 seconds or so. Do this until smooth."
- "Put chocolate sauce in a plastic bag (one tip clipped off) or piping bag. Decorate cookies."
- "Store in an air-tight container."
