Meat pies are pies with savory fillings of meat and other ingredients. Any party or potluck in Australia, South Africa, UK, New Zealand, Canada, Europe, Nigeria, Ghana and Canada is just incomplete without a meat pie on the counters. This recipe combines lean minced meat with onion and potato and is baked in a light puff pastry pie.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have pastry for meat pies using 6 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Pastry for meat pies:

1. Get 1/3 cup water
1. Prepare 1/4 pound lard
1. Get 2 cup all purpose flour
1. Make ready 1 tablespoon milk
1. Make ready 1/2 teaspoon salt
1. Make ready As needed flour for dusting


The pork adds a little fat so this will help to keep the pie succulent and moist. For the pastry, I have used our Lovefoodies Shortcrust Pastry recipe. This, in my opinion, is by far the best pastry to use for making this meat pie. The pastry is light and crispy, a little flaky and buttery.

##### Steps to make Pastry for meat pies:

1. Heat till the lard has melted.
1. Heat the milk, lard, water, and salt.
1. Add lard mixture to the flour and incorporate well.
1. Roll out the dough.
1. Dust with a bit of flour to keep from sticking. Use right away.


Pie Crust: Mix flour and shortening. Add all the cold water at once and mix delicately. After many years of using the same never fail pie pastry recipe I decided to compare mine to another &#34;never fail pastry&#34;. It didn&#39;t occur to me until after the pastry was made that the ratio of lard and flour is wrong. I have no problems with flaky crusts especially since I am used to making flaky puff pastry, but I need the crust to be more stable.
