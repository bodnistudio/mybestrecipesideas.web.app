- "You can add and/or subtract the spices to your liking. A good option is adding minced onions and Romano cheese. You can also make this a vegetarian dish by leaving out the meat. Or you can make meatballs and add them to this just before serving... I prefer the meat added in beforehand because it gives the sauce more flavour."

It will take a few hours to make the sauce as desired.
