Regular coffee waters down the mixture too much, and the ice cream doesn&#39;t hold. This doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t get a decent freeze-dried coffee from your favorite producer and region. With only four ingredients and some time to let the ice cream set, you&#39;ll have in your hands a smooth, tasty coffee ice cream that can compete with the most. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise with a sharp paring knife. Gently scrape out all the seeds.
