The combination of simple plain Italian crushed tomatoes, abundant olive oil and garlic, lots of fresh basil, shrimp and the cooking sequence below ensures both goals. The full flavor of the shrimp is captured in a remarkably simple and delicious sauce. The sauce still came out really good. I added way too much basil (dry not fresh) and I was a little worried.
