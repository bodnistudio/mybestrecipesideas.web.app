Ice Cream: I went with melted chocolate ice cream. It gives the yellow cake a touch of chocolate flavor, but not too much, since we&#39;ll also be adding in milk chocolate chips. I used Blue Bell Dutch Chocolate, because…um…I&#39;m in the South and because Blue Bell is life down here. Ice cream cake is the perfect dessert for any special occasion, including Passover. Spread matzo crackers with rich chocolate ganache and crown them with chocolate and mint chip ice cream.
