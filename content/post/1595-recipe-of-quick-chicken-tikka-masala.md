recipeinstructions:

- "(Optional) If you have Wooden Skewers, let them soak completely in a tub of water before using on chicken. This will prevent burning on the grill. Also, if you don&#39;t have a grill then you can use a cast iron skillet as a replacement for cooking the chicken. If you use the skillet then don&#39;t worry about skewering the chicken.

- "Start boiling water for the white rice/Couscous"
- "While your grill is pre-heating, make sure you dice your jalapeno and mince your garlic."
- "Now depending on the white rice you chose you either want to start it after or before step 7. If it&#39;s 10-15 mins to cook it, then do it after. Any longer then do it before step 7."
- "Melt butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Saute garlic and jalapeno for 1 minute. Season with 2 teaspoons cumin, paprika, and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir in tomato sauce and cream. Simmer on low heat until sauce thickens, about 20 minutes."
- "While your sauce is thickening, lightly oil the grill grate. Put Chicken on grill. Grill until juices run clear, about 5 minutes on each side."
- "Once sauce is done simmering, add grilled chicken, and simmer for 10 minutes. Add Rice to bowl first, put chicken and sauce on top. Add Cilantro if using."
