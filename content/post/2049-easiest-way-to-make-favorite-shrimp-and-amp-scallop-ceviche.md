Shrimp is one of the most commonly consumed types of shellfish. It is quite nutritious and provides high amounts of certain nutrients, such as iodine, that aren&#39;t abundant in many other foods. A perfectly cooked shrimp is firm enough to curl without being constricted, and it has an opaque pinky color with a sheen. When they are overcooked, shrimp turn matte white or gray. Another easy way to tell if your shrimp are cooked is if they are curled into a nice C shape.
