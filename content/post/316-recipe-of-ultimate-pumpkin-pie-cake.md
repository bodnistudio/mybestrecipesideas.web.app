	<strong>Pumpkin Pie Cake</strong>. 
	Pumpkin Pie Cake - six pumpkin cake layers with toasted marshmallow filling, pumpkin pie I later tried Milk Bar&#39;s Pumpkin Pie Cake and Apple Pie Cake and became the biggest fan of pie-inspired. This pumpkin pie cake combines traditional pumpkin pie with a buttery, crispy topping made from yellow cake mix. We often try to bring dishes to Grandma&#39;s house for Thanksgiving, as making dinner for a big group can be tough for one person!
