recipeinstructions:
- "Add olive oil, chopped red onions, minced garlic, black pepper, sea salt and dried basil to a pan and heat. Cook onions until translucent. About 5-6 minutes. Be careful not to burn your garlic."
- "Add all other ingredients in the Neapolitan Red Sauce section except for your fresh basil. Cover and allow sauce to simmer for at least an hour."
- "Using a potato masher, 30 minutes into simmer, gently mash your tomatoes and onions whereby creating more of a chunky puree."
- "In the last 15 minutes of your simmer, add your 6 chopped basil leaves. Reserve more whole leaves for pizza garnish finish. I also mash my red sauce once more at this point and add anything else my sauce may need. During long simmer times - flavors can easily dissipate. So, I&#39;ll usually add additional sea salt, 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder to steep quickly in my sauce. It&#39;s up to you!"
- "Allow sauce to cool before placing it on your pizzas. This sauce recipe equals four cooked cups."
- "° 45 minutes prior to baking your pizzas, heat oven and pizza stone to 500°. Later, turn oven down to 425°. Dust pizza stone with corn meal or, you can place your raw dough on parchment, then place it on your pizza stone.                                                   ° Bake about 5 - 7 minutes or, until crust is browned and slightly firm.                                                                                                                                         ° Allow crust to cool a bit before constructing pizzas. Remember, these pizza crusts go back in the oven to bake again once topped. This easy technique ensures you won&#39;t have raw dough in the center of your pizzas."
- "If using a pre-fabed pie crust such as Mama Mary&#39;s or Boboli, lightly brush the outer edges with olive oil and bake for 5-7 minutes until crust is slightly browned and crispy."
- "° Ladle your sauce on your crust stopping about a 1/2&#34; from the edges.                                                                        ° Slice your Motzerella thin or, break it up and position it how you&#39;d like on your pizza.
