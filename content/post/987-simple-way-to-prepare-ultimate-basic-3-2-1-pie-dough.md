recipeinstructions:
- "Add flour to a large bowl. If using unsalted butter, mix in a few pinches of salt."
- "Cut chilled butter into small cubes and add to flour. Crumble it into the flour with your fingers until the butter turns to pea-sized pieces and dough is sandy."
- "Mix in the sugar if using. Then gradually mix in the ice water until the dough start to come together."
- "On a floured surface knead dough briefly until it forms a smooth ball."
- "Wrap each ball and refrigerate for at least 1 or 2 hours. You can also make ahead and keep in the fridge up to 1 week before using."
- "Roll out when ready to get baking! On a well floured surface, unwrap one ball of dough, sprinkle with some flour and start rolling out with your rolling pin."
- "Divide into two equal pies if you made the full recipe."
- "Roll out a little, lift and turn it a quarter turn and roll out more. Repeat several times until it&#39;s rolled out into a 30-32 cm (12-13 in) circle."
- "Trim the rough edges with a knife so it&#39;s a pretty 30 cm/12 in circle (or smaller for smaller pie/tart pan). I used a big bowl as a stencil to cut out."
- "Here it is after cutting."
- "Gently lay the trimmed crust into your pie dish and fold over the excess edges. You can make a crimping pattern or use a fork pattern the edges."
- "If you don&#39;t need to blind bake, go ahead and add your filling and stick it in the oven!"
- "To blind bake for very wet fillings, lay a piece of aluminum foil over the pie crust and fill it with pie weights or dry beans. Bake at 425 F/210 C for 10 minutes or until slightly golden."
