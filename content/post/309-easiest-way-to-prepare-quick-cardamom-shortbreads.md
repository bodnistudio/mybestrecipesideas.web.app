recipeinstructions:
- "Lightly crush the cardamom pods to release the seeds, discard the shells and put the seeds into a mortar. Crush finely with the pestle."
- "Place the butter, ground rice, flour and icing sugar in a food processor and mix until you have a dough."
- "Turn the dough out onto the work surface and push with your hands into a roll, about 3-4 cm in diameter. Wrap in plastic film and place in the fridge for an hour. Chilling is an important stage, don&#39;t rush it, otherwise the shortbreads will spread too much when they&#39;re cooking."
- "Take the roll out of the fridge and remove the film. Brush with beaten egg and roll in demerara sugar. Place back in the fridge for another 30 minutes."
- "Preheat the oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Take the roll out of the fridge and cut into thin slices, about 5mm thick, and place on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment. You could cut the roll in two and store the other half in the fridge for baking another day. I used half the roll and it made 13 biscuits."
- "Sprinkle a little vanilla sugar over the top of the biscuits and bake for around 15 minutes on a low shelf. I think the secret of getting these shortbreads crisp is to make sure you don&#39;t cook them too quickly, and that they bake to a pale golden colour."
- "Cool on a wire rack and don&#39;t store in a jar or a tin until they are completely cold."
