- " Pineapple in Juice"
- " Red Onion"
- " Red Pepper Flakes"
- " Brussel Sprouts"
- " Garlic"
- " Corn Starch"
- " Garlic Salt"
- " Oil"
- " Brown Sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start Rice in a pot or Rice Cooker (I sometimes add a drizzle of pineapple juice in - but not too much or the sugars will burn) according to package directions."
- "In a large skillet pour a few tablespoons of oil.  Add red pepper flakes to taste - I add about a full teaspoon.  Add garlic salt to taste - this depends how salty the keilbasa is that you are using. Turn the stove on low and allow the oil to warm."
- "Chop your keilbasa or polish sausage or whatever meat you are using into bite sized pieces (again we love Adelle chicken sausages like sundried tomatoe and artichoke heart).  Add it to the oil and turn up the heat.  Add a bag of frozen brussel sprouts or halved fresh brussel sprouts once your sausage has browned."
- "Once the brussel sprouts are also browned, add a chopped onion and some rough chopped garlic and turn the heat down. When your onions are just getting soft, add most of the juice from the can of pineapple and about 1/4 c of brown sugar or substitute.  Allow this mixture to simmer for about 20 minutes.  Stir every once in a while to prevent the sugar from burning."
- "Mix some corn starch in a little (1/2 cup or so) bowl of water and mix well then stir into the mixture in the pan and stir well.  This will thicken the sauce.  Add in the pineapple pieces and cook an additional 5-10 minutes. Serve over your yummy rice!  Sweet, spicy and savory.  And cheap!"
