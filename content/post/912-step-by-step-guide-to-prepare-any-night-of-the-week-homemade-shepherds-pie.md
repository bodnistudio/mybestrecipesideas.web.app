<h3>Instructions to make Homemade Shepherds Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Peel the potatoes so there&#39;s no skin. Then cut them into medium cubes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Take an onion and chop it into tiny pieces..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cook the 2.25 lbs of hamburger with the chopped onions in the hamburger as you&#39;re browning it. Takes about 7 minutes to brown the meat with the tiny pieces of onion for flavor..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			While you&#39;re browning the hamburger and onions, boil the cubes of the potatoes on another burner to save time. Boil until you take a piece of potato out and take a fork and see if it mashes easily with the fork. Takes about 10 minutes to make the potatoes soft enough to mash with a fork.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			After the meat is browned. Spread the hamburger at the bottom of the aluminum tin to make the bottom layer..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Then strain the potatoes out of the pot. Then put the potatoes from the strainer into the pot you just used. Then put in the pot the 1/2 cup of milk and take a fork and mash the potatoes. Keep mashing with the fork and stirring the potatoes. When they&#39;re all mashed if it&#39;s not the consistency you want if you want it more watery then add more milk..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			After the potatoes are the right consistency, add the cream cheese not all at once but in bits and taste while you&#39;re adding to get the flavor of the potatoes that you want..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Take the 2 cans of corn and make a layer of corn over the hamburger in the cake tin..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Take the potatoes that taste the way you want and spread it on top of the corn. To make a layer that doesn&#39;t mix with the corn, pour the potatoes in clumps all over the corn and then carefully spread the potatoes to make the top layer..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Take the 2 cups of shredded cheese and layer the top of the potatoes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Take the tin with the shepherds pie and put it in the oven at 325° for 20 minutes or longer if you want the potatoes browner..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Then eat and enjoy. Great meal that doesn&#39;t take too long!!.
