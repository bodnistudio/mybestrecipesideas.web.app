(Check YouTube for some good videos on this) It will start to expand so be sure to rotate as you are moving it. Get it to the size you want and you are good to go with your toppings"
- "Once your base is ready, you just need add your toppings for either a red or white pizza and then cook"
- "Cook at a very high heat in the oven or ideally in a pizza oven or kamado. If you have a pizza stone, get that in. It will cook quick and if you don&#39;t keep your eyes on the prize it&#39;ll burn. In the pizza oven/kamado you are talking 3-4mins in a regular oven maybe double"
