- "8 Storebought gyoza not prefried"
- "1 Egg"
- "2 tbsp Chinese chicken stock powder"
- "800 ml Water"
- "1 tbsp each Soy sauce sesame oil"

recipeinstructions:
- "Cheat a bit by using store-bought gyoza!  This makes 2 servings as a main dish, or 4 servings if it&#39;s a side dish."
- "Fill a pot with water, add the chicken stock, and bring to a boil. Prepare your katakuriko slurry in the meantime. In another separate bowl, prepare the beaten egg."
- "Put in the gyoza and simmer until the skins start to turn translucent and they are cooked through. The photo shows 1 serving. I added Japanese leeks, since I happened to have some."
- "The skins have turned translucent. Now, add the katakuriko slurry, swirling the soup around with chopsticks from the center to the edges. Keep simmering."
- "Continue swirling and add the beaten egg a few drops at a time. Swirl gently in a circle."
- "Turn off the heat as soon as the egg floats to the top. It&#39;ll get hard if you don&#39;t. Add the soy sauce and sesame oil, and it&#39;s done. Put in some chopped leek, if you have some."
- "Thicken the soup, even if it&#39;s a bother. The egg will be less likely to sink, and the soup will stay hot. It also makes it easier to eat."
