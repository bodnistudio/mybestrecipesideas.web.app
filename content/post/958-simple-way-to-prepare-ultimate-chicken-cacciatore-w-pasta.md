For as long as we have hunted, there&#39;s been cacciatore. In Italian, cacciatore means hunter, and speaks to a specific type of cuisine. Chicken Cacciatore generally involves browning chicken pieces in a pot over high heat, then sauteing a mix of vegetables—onions, peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes—in the same pot. Spices are added, followed by a little wine, and the chicken and veggies are allowed to cook together in the oven long enough for magic to happen… And magic does happen. Chicken cacciatore lends itself well to being served with a variety of side dishes, including polenta, buttered noodles, rice pasta and mashed potatoes.
