Once done, place the vegetables in a dish and put to one side. I designed this recipe to work well in a regular skillet (preferably cast iron), since most of us don&#39;t have woks at home. The only tricky part, which really isn&#39;t so difficult, is to cook the eggs, vegetables and rice separately, and combine them all at the end. really easy and yummy! I am a bit obsessed with fried rice.

It was the first food, along with egg drop soup, that I learned to eat at Chinese restaurants as a kid. But somehow, I never quite grew out of it and admittedly still order fried rice nearly every time we hit up a Chinese restaurant or takeout. This easy recipe for fried rice, takes already cooked white rice and quickly transforms it into better than takeout vegetable fried rice with egg. It&#39;s perfect for busy weeknights and it&#39;ll be enjoyed by the entire family. You can serve it as a side dish or it can be a stand alone meal.
