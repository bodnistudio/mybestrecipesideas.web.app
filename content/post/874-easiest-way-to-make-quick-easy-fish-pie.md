	<strong>Easy Fish Pie 🐟</strong>. 
	This is the easiest fish pie I have ever made. I used cod and haddock for the white fish and a few extra shrimp as there were some left in the bag. It instructions are simple, the sauce with its dash of mustard and lemon had a nice slight &#34;tang&#34;.

		Serve fish pie with peas or other fresh greens.
	
		Cut the potatoes into small even-sized chunks and place in a saucepan with enough water to just cover.
	
		Having a chunk of something smoked is definitely a must as far as I like it, it brings a real depth and richness to the dish as well as (again!) making it more sustainable since we have real good smoked fish available to buy online or in supermarkets.

			When all your fish, eggs and potatoes are cooking make a simple sauce. Melt the butter in a pan and add the milk. Stir the sauce flour with a small amount of water to make a paste and then add to the mix. Stir the mixture until it is thick and smooth. You could add grated cheese here if you want - but this will make the sauce very rich..
