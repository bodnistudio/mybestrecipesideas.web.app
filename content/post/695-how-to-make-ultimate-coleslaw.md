This creamy coleslaw recipe is great for potlucks or to serve to your family on a busy weeknight. â€”Renee Endress, Galva, Illinois This coleslaw is a great side dish to bring to summer potlucks, and pairs well with recipes like Slow Cooker Pulled Pork, tacos (especially fish tacos), lunch wraps with deli meat, hot dogs, and more. I don&#39;t recommend it, as raw cabbage does not freeze well. Make coleslaw dressing: In a small mixing bowl whisk together the mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar and honey. If needed season with a bit of salt.
