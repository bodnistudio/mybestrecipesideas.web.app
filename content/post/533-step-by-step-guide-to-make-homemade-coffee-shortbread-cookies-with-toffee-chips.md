The flavor combination here is a mellow play on that drink. Tips for making toffee shortbread cookies: Use HIGH quality butter: the main ingredient in shortbread cookies is butter â€” use a good brand and avoid any margarines/butter spreads.; Don&#39;t skimp on the chilling time: chilling shortbread cookies are vital to the end result as far as texture and flavor; don&#39;t rush this step!; Roll even &#34;logs&#34; of dough: the more even and uniform your logs. Fold in some Heath toffee bits and mini chocolate chips and it&#39;s ready to bake up! The toffee bits get mixed into the cookie dough, so these shortbread cookies are already a bit fun. To take it up a notch, I recommend rolling the cookie dough in turbinado sugar before baking. (Also known as sugar in the raw.) I did learn the hard way NOT to roll the shortbread cookies in the toffee pieces.
