Pour the room temperature or chilled coffee into the glass. Leave room for cream and sugar if you take it that way. Add any additional ingredients you like in your coffee (simple syrup is a great way to sweeten up iced coffee), and stir. I prefer SilkÂ® Coconut Milk Beverage and I like to sweeten it with stevia.&#34; Iced coffee is a type of coffee beverage served chilled, brewed variously with the fundamental division being cold brew - brewing the coffee cold, yielding a different flavor, and not requiring cooling - or brewing normally (hot) and then cooling, generally by simply pouring over ice or into ice cold milk. In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring are often mixed into the hot coffee before.
