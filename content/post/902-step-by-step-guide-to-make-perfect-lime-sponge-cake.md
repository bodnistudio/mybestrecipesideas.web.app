recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 170°c fan."
- "In a large mixing bowl whisk the butter and caster sugar until pale and fluffy."
- "Add the eggs to the bowl and whisk until fully combined and bubbles form. Be sure not to over whisk. Then grate the zest of both limes into the bowl and mix into the batter."
- "Sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl and gently fold into the mixture until fully combined. Take your time, being gentle with the batter is crucial for getting a light and fluffy cake."
- "Add the juice of 1 lime to the batter and gently fold that in. The lime will slightly react with the baking powder to form bubbles in the mixture."
- "Line two 20cm sandwich tins with greaseproof paper. Divide the mixture equally between the tins and spread evenly. While doing this be as gentle with the batter as you can be so you don&#39;t lose the air. You can see below how the bubbles are still in the mixture when this is done."
- "Put the cakes into the oven for 20 minutes until golden and a knife or skewer comes out clean. Take them out of the tins and leave to cool completely, preferably on a wire rack."
- "For the buttercream. Whisk together the butter and icing sugar until smooth. Add the zest of the lime with 2 tsp of juice and whisk again."
- "Spread the buttercream evenly over one half of the cake and then sandwich the other cake on top. You can then dust the top with icing sugar if you want to. Then serve."
