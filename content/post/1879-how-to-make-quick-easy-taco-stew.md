These lettuce wrap steak tacos were inspired by tacos I recently oredered at a Tex-Mex restaurant in NYC. They were so good, I didn&#39;t miss the tortilla so I set out to recreate them at home. They used iceburg lettuce which they cut on an angle and used several layers which I thought was smart. These Easy Tacos Al Pastor feature flavoured pork tenderloin, grilled with pineapple and onion and served with a fresh pineapple salsa. My Easy Tacos Al Pastor start with pork tenderloin and can be cooked on the BBQ, in a grill pan or in the oven!
