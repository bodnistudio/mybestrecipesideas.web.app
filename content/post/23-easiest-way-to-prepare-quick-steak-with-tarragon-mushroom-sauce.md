recipeingredient:
- " Steak of your choice I used flank but rib or sirloin work too"
- "500 g white or brown mushrooms"
- "1 shallot finely chopped"
- "2 cloves garlic finely chopped"
- "1/2 cup brandy"
- "1/2 cup beef stock"
- "2 tbsp fresh tarragon chopped"
- "1/4 cup heavy cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "The night before, season the steak with salt and place it uncovered in the fridge. This allows the salt time to penetrate the meat, and the cool air dries out the surface of the steak, allowing for a better crust. Take the steak out of the fridge about 20 minutes before cooking."
- "Add a knob of butter and a splash of olive oil to a large pan on high heat. Sear the steak to your liking (I go about 4 minutes per side, depending on thickness). Remove the steak to a plate and tent it loosely with foil to rest."
- "Add the mushrooms to the pan and fry until they release water, about 2 minutes. Let the liquid cook off, then add the shallot and garlic. Fry about 1 minute until fragrant."
- "Add the brandy to the pan. Let the alcohol boil off, then add the beef stock. Simmer until the liquid reduces by about half, about 2 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and stir in the tarragon and cream. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve the mushrooms and sauce on the side, or spoon it onto the steak."

Hard sear the steak over high heat (remember to generously salt and lightly pepper the outside of the steak) to get its outsides a bit crunchy.
