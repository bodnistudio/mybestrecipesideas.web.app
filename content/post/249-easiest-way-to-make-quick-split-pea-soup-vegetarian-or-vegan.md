This richly flavored soup is hearty and satisfying and makes a delicious plant-based appetizer or main. Our vegan tomato soup and vegan tomato basil soup are both tomato soups but are totally different, try both if you&#39;re a fan of tomatoes! Obviously there&#39;s no ham in here. Instead I seasoned it with a touch of liquid smoke, which is pretty much magic in a Instant Pot Split Pea Soup. Don&#39;t have time to let your soup simmer for an hour or more?
