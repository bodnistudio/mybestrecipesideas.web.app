Whether it&#39;s this amazing vegetarian option or my popular tear and share meaty version, my family devour sausage rolls ðŸ™‚ Place the long sausage roll onto the baking tray, seam-side-down and either arrange into a spiral or a ring. If arranging into a ring, seal the ends of the pastry together with egg wash. Cut into the pastry to make small sausage rolls - cutting from the outside towards the middle. Don&#39;t cut all the way through though. V-Bites&#39; Cheezly &amp; Cranberry Bites, Sausage &amp; Bacon Style Wraps, and Pork Style Sausage Rolls from their VegiDeli range are just a few delicious snacks that are perfect accompaniments for your Christmas spread or a festive buffet.
