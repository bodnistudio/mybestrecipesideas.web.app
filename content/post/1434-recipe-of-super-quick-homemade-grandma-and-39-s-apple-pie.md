recipeingredient:
- " latticetop pie"
- "2 cup allpurpose flour"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "2/3 cup shortening or chilled butter cut into small cubes unsalted unless making a savory pie"
- "2 tbsp sugar granulated or icing sugar"
- "1 ice cold water around 68 tablespoons"
- "3 egg yolks"
- " pie filling"
- "6 apples peeled cored and thinly sliced I prefer Gala Fuji or Pacific Rose"
- "3/4 to 1 cup sugar according to apples used preferably powered"
- "2 tbsp flour for thickening"
- "1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- "pinch full of ground nutmeg"
- "1 tbsp lime juice"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "2 tbsp butter or margarine"
recipeinstructions:
- "For pastry; mix flour, salt and sugar together and add butter to it. Toss the mix with a fork until small pea-sized lumps begin to form."
- "Slowly start adding ice cold water to the mixture, around 1 tablespoon at a time, while mixing it all together (in this step mix by using hands or a blender. Hands preferred so you know the consistency of the dough.). Continue adding water until the dough just starts to hold together. Do not add too much water or you will have a chewy, tough crust."
- "Form the dough in a mound (do not over knead the dough. This will release gluten and spoil the texture of pie crust). Divide it into two parts. Form into ballls. Roll one balls out around 1/8 inch thick over a floured surface. You could choose to refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes before the rolling it out but that&#39;s optional."
- "Line the rolled pastry in a pie plate, trim off the excess dough along the edges and cover the plate with some cling film. I used an 8 inch removal-bottom plate in this recipe."
- "Toss the plate into fridge and let it cool for at least 30 minutes to an hour. Meanwhile heat your oven to 180°C."
- "Remove the pie plate from the fridge, take off the cling film. Prick the lined pastry a few times all over with a fork. This will avoid formation of bubbles or uneven baking. But do not prick if filling and crust are baked together."
- "Bake the pie for around 20 minutes or until it is golden in color. You could also line the pastry with baking paper, put some weights like beans over the baking paper and then bake. This too ensures no bubbles form in the pie crust."
- "Let the pie crust cool. Beat 3 egg yolks and give the baked crust a nice egg wash. Bake again at 180°C for 5 minutes. This makes the crust water-proof, ie it won&#39;t get soggy after you add filling to the pie."
- "Mix all the filling ingredients together and fill into the baked pie crust. Dot butter or margarine over the filling. I added a few cashew nut pieces to the filling for a little crunch."
- "For the top crust, roll the other ball of dough (preferably refrigerated before rolling) and cut it into 1/2 inch thick stripes with a knife or a pizze cutter. Weave the mesh like pattern right over the pie plate after adding the filling. Trim off the excess dough along the edges of the plate. Give the top crust a nice egg wash."
- "Bake the pie for about 50 minutes at 180°C or until top crust is nice and golden."
- "Enjoy the fruits of your labor with some freah cream!"
