Chicken piccata is nothing more than chicken breast cutlets, dredged in flour, browned, and served with a sauce of butter, lemon juice, capers, and either stock or white wine. Chicken Picatta is an Italian dish similar to Chicken Francaise only Francaise dips the chicken into flour and an egg wash before pan frying; Piccata typically only dips the meat into flour and also adds capers to it&#39;s lemon butter sauce. My version, is made without flour. Make Ahead: The chicken can be breaded and refrigerated up to four hours ahead of time. I often make chicken picatta dipped in flour then egg omitting the breadcumbs.
