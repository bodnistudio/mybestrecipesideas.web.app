For the most part I followed the recipe as written (there are infinite variations you could try) except for cooking the egg separately like a crepe then rolling it up like a cigar and slicing it chiffonade-style for a more authentic presentation. Tips For Making The Best Fried Rice: Ok, let&#39;s get right to it. A fresh batch of warm (or even lukewarm) rice will not fry well when it hits the hot pan, and will result in soggy and sticky clumps — no good. Add the egg and break it up to scramble it and add the onion right away also. Add eggs and swirl to coat pan; cook egg through, remove to a plate and break egg up into small pieces with a fork.
