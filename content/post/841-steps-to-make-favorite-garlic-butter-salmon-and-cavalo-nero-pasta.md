##### The ingredients needed to make Garlic Butter Salmon and Cavalo Nero Pasta:

1. Prepare 2 x 180g portion of salmon

Plus, I also decided to up the protein content with the addition of some smoked salmon. I figured that the smoked salmon would definitely go with the cream, and the smoky flavour would probably be good with the kale, too. Cook for a mere minute so that it retains a little crunch, then drain the pasta and cavolo nero well, tossing in a drizzle of olive oil. Set aside while you finish the sauce.

When the onions are really soft, turn the heat back up again and add the garlic, frying for just a minute or so until you can smell the aroma wafting up from the pan. To make the garlic beurre noisette, melt the butter in a small frying pan over a medium heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until it&#39;s golden brown and smells nutty. Add the garlic, let it sizzle for a few seconds, then add the lemon juice and quickly tip onto the cavolo nero. Slice the garlic and add to the cavolo nero along with the chilli flakes, capers, a pinch of salt, and a tbsp more of olive oil. Reserve a cup of pasta water from your spaghetti and add into the pan just before the garlic begins to brown.
