I also added some green onions for color and flavor along with a bit of salt and pepper for taste. Usually a (great) tuna salad contains heaps of mayo, adding an incredible amount of extra fat and calories. As mentioned above though, this tuna salad gets its creaminess from healthy avocado slices. There is NO NEED for mayo in this! You can use tuna canned in oil, brine or spring water.
