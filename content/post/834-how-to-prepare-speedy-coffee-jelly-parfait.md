My mom used to make us coffee jelly as a kid - rich and bitter coffee jelly cubes in a bath of cream and condensed milk. This slime is a reflection of this memory. The sponges are black and unbreakable. To soften this slime in case of winter stiffness, add some warm water.. I layered the squares of gelatin in a parfait glass w/ spoonfuls of whipped cream (one dollop is not going to be enough) &amp; drizzled chocolate syrup &amp; caramel syrup over the layers.
