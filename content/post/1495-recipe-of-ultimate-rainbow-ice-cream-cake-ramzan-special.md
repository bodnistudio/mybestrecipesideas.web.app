I&#39;ve wanted to make an ice cream cake for a while now, as I dream about the cookie crumb filling that Dairy Queen layers in their ice cream cakes! I&#39;m not a huge fan of vanilla ice cream, but I swear I can taste rainbows when I bite into this one. To make the ice cream layer, whisk together the condensed milk, double cream and vanilla until thick. Pour in to a cling film-lined cake tin the same size as the ones you&#39;re going to bake the cakes in. Rainbow layer cake is surprisingly easy to create, thanks to a little help from Betty Crocker™ Super Moist™ vanilla cake mix and Betty Crocker™ And now that you&#39;ve got rainbow cake mix mastered, you can find traditional favorites, quick-and-easy shortcuts and fun new twists in Betty&#39;s Best Layer.
