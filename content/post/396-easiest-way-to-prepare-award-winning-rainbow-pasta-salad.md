##### Instructions to make Rainbow Pasta Salad:

In a large saucepan, combine the tomato sauce, onion, vinegar, garlic, and oregano. It could be anything like penne, farfalle, small shellsâ€¦ I have some rotini, so rotini it is. When you drain your pasta stir in a little olive oil so it doesn&#39;t stick to together. Cook pasta according to package directions. Rinse in cold water and drain; place in a large bowl.
