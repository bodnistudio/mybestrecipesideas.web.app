recipeinstructions:
- "Prep all your ingredients. Heat a large stock pot over medium heat with a little oil. Add your onions first and let them cook down a bit. Then add the garlic. Once the onions and garlic start to get some color and slightly caramelize you can throw in the rest of the fresh veggies. Add salt and pepper and stir. Turn heat down to medium low &amp; cover. Cook until everything starts to soften."
- "Once the veggies have softened add the tomato paste and seasoning blend. With a wooden spatula stir everything together well. You want the tomato paste and the seasonings to cook just for a minute a two. Then add all your can tomatoes. Stir and bring to a simmer for about 15 minutes uncovered."
- "Once it has simmered add the beans and Broth. Eyeball how much broth you use. I like a thicker chili so I only used about 3 cups. Bring back to a simmer for about 10 minutes."
- "At this point I cooled mine down and put in the fridge overnight. I reheated it the next day in the crockpot for a party. I personally think it was better the next day. If you want it the same day cover and let cook on low heat for about an hour. Serve up with your favorite fixings and enjoy... All my guests did. Even the manliest meat eaters loved it."
