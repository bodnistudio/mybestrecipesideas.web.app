Pecan Brown Sugar Baked Cake Donuts. These glazed cake donuts are bomb diggity, my friends. Light and fluffy, yet delectably dense with warm, cozy notes of cinnamon, brown sugar and oodles of crunchy, salty, nutty pecans. The glaze is sweet, maple-y, barely boozy and magically delicious. Allow doughnuts to cool a few minutes in the pan before transferring to a wire wrack to cool for a few more minutes.
