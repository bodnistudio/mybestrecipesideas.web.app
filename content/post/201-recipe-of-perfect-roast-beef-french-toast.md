For the custard: Break the eggs into a bowl and whisk together. I&#39;ve used consomme forever due to it&#39;s weight &amp; flavor. However, absolutely NOT a fan of deli roast beef b/c it does not even resemb le real roast beef in flavor. In a small bowl, combine oil, garlic, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper. Place roast in roasting pan fitted with a roasting rack.
