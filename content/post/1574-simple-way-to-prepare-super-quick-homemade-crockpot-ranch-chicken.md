Ingredients for Crockpot Ranch Chicken Taco Chicken - I used boneless skinless chicken breasts but you could use chicken thighs as well! Chicken Broth - use broth instead of water to add more flavor. You&#39;ve got lots of serving options with this. It had just enough broth to serve it as a thick soup/stew of sorts…but if you aren&#39;t looking for a soup you can.
