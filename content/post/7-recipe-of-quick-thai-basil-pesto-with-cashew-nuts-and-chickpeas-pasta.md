I swapped the usual pine nuts for cashew nuts, and used fresh coriander (cilantro) instead of basil. I also added garlic, chilli, spring onion, and even a dash of coconut milk to make it nice and saucy. This is so simple yet amazingly delicious!!! Use it on pasta, chicken, fish or spread on crackers or crostini!!!
