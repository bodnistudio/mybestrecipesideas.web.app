			Gently stir 1/4 of the whipped cream into the strawberry mixture to lighten up. Then carefully add all of strawberry mixture to remaining whipped cream, and gently fold in until fully incorporated..

			Note: You can make a homemade graham cracker crust with 1 1/2 cups fine graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, and 4 tbs melted unsalted butter. Mix all together until all crumbs are moistened and press into a 8-9 inch pie plate (bottoms and up the sides). Chill at least 1 hour before filling..
