<h3>Steps to make Homemade Lemon Meringue Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			For making Pie Crust: Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the butter and shortening..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Using a pastry cutter (the one I own) or two forks, cut the butter and shortening into the mixture until it resembles coarse meal (pea-sized bits with a few larger bits of fat is ok)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water in a cup. Add ice. Stir it around. From that, measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water– since the ice has melted a bit..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Drizzle the cold water in, 1 Tablespoon (15ml) at a time, and stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon after every Tablespoon (15ml) added. Do not add any more water than you need to..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Stop adding water when the dough begins to form large clumps. I always use about 1/2 cup (120ml) of water and a little more in dry winter months (up to 3/4 cup)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Transfer the pie dough to a floured work surface. The dough should come together easily and should not feel overly sticky..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Using floured hands, fold the dough into itself until the flour is fully incorporated into the fats. Form it into a ball. Divide dough in half. Flatten each half into 1-inch thick discs using your hands..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours (and up to 5 days)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			For making the filling: Whisk the egg yolk in a medium bowl. Set aside..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Set aside. Whisk the water, granulated sugar, cornstarch, salt, lemon juice, and lemon zest together in a medium saucepan over medium heat..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			The mixture will be thin and cloudy, then eventually begin thickening and bubbling after about 6 minutes. Once thickened, give it a whisk and reduce heat to low..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Temper the egg yolks: Very slowly stream a few large spoonfuls of warm lemon mixture into the beaten egg yolks..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Then, also in a very slow stream, whisk the egg yolk mixture into the saucepan. Turn heat back up to medium.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cook until the mixture is thick and big bubbles begin bursting at the surface..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Remove the pan from heat and whisk in the butter. Spread filling into the warm partially baked crust. Set aside..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Don’t let the filling cool down too much as you want a warm filling when you top with the meringue. The warm filling helps seal the two layers together, preventing separation..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			For baking pie crust: Roll the dough into a 12 inch round and place in the bottom of a 10 inch pie plate..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Trim and flute the edges as desired. Poke a few holes in the bottom of the pastry shell, rest in the frigerator for an additional 20 minutes before baking at 180 degrees C for 12 – 15 minutes or until golden brown..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cool completely before adding the filling..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			For making the meringue: With a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar together on high speed until soft peaks form, about 5 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the sugar and salt, then continue beating on high speed until glossy stiff peaks form, about 2 more minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Spread meringue on top of filling. (I like to make decorative peaks with the back of a large spoon)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Make sure you spread the meringue all the way to the edges so that it touches the crust. This helps prevent the meringue from weeping..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the meringue is browned on top. Remove from the oven, place on a wire rack, and allow to cool at room temperature for 1 hour before placing in the refrigerator to chill..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Chill for 4 hours before slicing and serving..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Note: Lemon meringue pie tastes best on day 1 because it doesn’t keep very well. No matter how hard you try to prevent it, the meringue will wilt and separate over time. Best to enjoy right away..
