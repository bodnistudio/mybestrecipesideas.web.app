		</li>
	
		<li>
			Drizzle the ice cold water into the mix and press it together (not knead) to make a dough..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Divide this into two, roll into balls, flatted into discs, wrap up in clingwrap and chill overnight..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			The next day, roll one of the two dough ball (or disc) into a disc and line an 8&#34; pie tin with it. Fork the dough to make holes in it all over (not too many that the filling might leak)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Roll out the other dough ball and cut it into half inch strips..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a mixing bowl, mix all the filling ingredients (scrape out the vanilla bean with a knife and throw the pods away, use only the insides)..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Pour this into the pie tin lined with pastry dough and smoothen flat..
			
			
		</li>

		</li>

		</li>
	
		<li>
			Preheat an oven to 200°C for 15 minutes while the pie chills..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake the pie for 15 minutes and then lower the temperature to 175°C and cook for an additional 30 minutes, or till the top of the pie is beautifully browned..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Once ready, cool for a half hour or more before slicing up and serving (with vanilla ice cream, if you&#39;re feeling fancy).
			
			
		</li>
