One would think that one could merely pour brewed coffee into a glass full of ice and call it a day…but I find that method extremely flawed. First, no matter how packed with ice the glass is, once the hot coffee hits, some of the ice is bound to melt. Cold-brewed coffee poured over coffee ice cubes makes the best iced coffee. It takes a bit of planning, but its full, rich flavor makes the wait worthwhile. The ideal coffee for this cold drink is a blend of mid-roasted beans with moderate acid.
