<h3>Instructions to make Vickys Christmas Mincemeat Puff Pastry Pies, GF DF EF SF NF:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			To make the mincemeat, put all the ingredients into a large bowl except for the brandy, and combine well.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let sit in a cool dark place for 12 hours overnight to let the flavours develop.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Preheat the oven on the lowest setting around gas mark 1/4 / 120C / 225°F.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Put the mincemeat mixture into a large ovenproof dish, cover with foil and bake for 3 hours.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			When you take it out it will look like it&#39;s swimming in grease, it&#39;s meant to so don&#39;t panic!.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Let it cool stirring when you feel like it. Stir in the brandy when it&#39;s completely cooled.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			This is enough to fill 3 x 450g sterilized jars. Fill the jars to the top and place a waxed disc on top before putting the lids on. Will keep for a year in a cupboard. Makes a nice Christmas gift if you tie a gift tag around the neck with pretty ribbon and the pie recipe below written on....
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Preheat the oven to gas 7 / 220C / 425°F. Roll out the puff pastry and cut out 24 discs around 4cm sized

		</li>
	
		<li>
			Put 12 pastry discs onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Spoon some mincemeat onto the middle, don&#39;t go overboard as the suet will bubble out and burst your pies, leave room around the edge.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Brush some milk of choice around the edge and put the remaining 12 discs on top, pinching the sides together upwards to create a shell and lid and prick the tops with a knife.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Brush the tops with some more milk, sprinkle with caster sugar and bake for 15-20 minutes or until risen and golden.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before moving gently to a wire rack to cool completely.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Serve cold with a dusting of icing sugar, or warm with some brandy butter or clotted cream and a glass of sherry! Pure Christmas!.
