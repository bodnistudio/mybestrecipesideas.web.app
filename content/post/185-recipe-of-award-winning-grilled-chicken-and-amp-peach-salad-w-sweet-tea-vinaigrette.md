You can put grilled chicken in just about anything: sliced on top of salads, stuffed into sandwiches, shredded for chicken soups or skewered on a kabob. Grilled chicken breasts can be the epitome of boring. Too often they&#39;re dried out or rubbery. But when soaked in a super-quick marinade — with balsamic, brown sugar, and dried thyme — you&#39;re. Because boneless chicken breasts are so lean, they often turn out dry, rubbery, and bland.
