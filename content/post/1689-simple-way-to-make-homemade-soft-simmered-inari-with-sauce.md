recipeingredient:
- "1 block Tofu"
- "5 small deep fried bean curd or koage"
- "3 tbsp Hijiki seaweed"
- "150 grams Ground meat"
- "4 cm Carrot"
- " Sauce ingredients"
- "4 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- "5 tbsp Sake"
- "1 Ginger"
recipeinstructions:
- "Get rid of the surface oil on the fried bean curd by boiling them for 1 to 2 minutes and draining them on a sieve until cooled. Wash the hijiki seaweed and rehydrate in plenty of water to cover until softened."
- "Put the tofu, hijiki seaweed, ground meat and finely julienned carrot in a bowl and mix well together with your hands in the same way you&#39;d mix hamburger meat."
- "Add the flavoring ingredients - soy sauce, sugar, sake, and grated ginger - in a pan. Stuff the fried bean curd with the mixture from step 2 and line up the filled pockets in the pan. Start cooking over high heat, and when it comes to a boil lower the heat and simmer gently for about 10 minutes."
- "The pockets will become nice and puffy. Poke one of the pockets in the middle of the filling with a chopstick, and if the liquid runs clear they are done. Take the pockets out of the pan, leaving the cooking liquid."
- "Thicken the liquid with katakuriko dissolved in water (not listed). It&#39;ll be better if the sauce is a bit on the thick and creamy side."
