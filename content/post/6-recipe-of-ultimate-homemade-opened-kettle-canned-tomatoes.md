recipeingredient:
- "1 half bushel of tomatoes"
- "2 TBSP NON IODIZED PLAIN SALTadd or reduce to your tastes"
recipeinstructions:
- "Lay out your tomatoes on a table. This gives you a chance to look for any that might be rotten, and any rotten one to spread to other tomatoes"
- "Boil water in a large pot. While the water is boiling lay tomatoes in a plugged sink."
- "Pour the boiling water in the sink and let sit for 1 minute. This will blister and swell the tomato skins to make peeling easier."
- "Drain the water carefully, and peel the skin off the tomatoes and remove the stem cores."
- "After the tomato is cored and peeled, slice the tomato into chunks. You should slice these over a bowl so you keep the juice."
- "Place the tomatoes in a pot, and set the flame to simmer. Stir the tomatoes until the move freely. All the tomatoes may move all together. This is okay, it means juice is on the bottom so the tomatoes do not burn."
- "Once the tomatoes warm a bit, taste a sample, and salt to taste. For me a 14 quart pot, needs about 2 tablespoons of salt. Continue heating until the tomatoes have lots of foam. DO NOT USE IODIZED SALT. I was told using iodized salt can cause botulism. It could be a old wives tale, but in 40 years I have never had a bad batch, so I am not changing what works üòÅ"
- "Once you get a good simmer, like in the photo above, taste it one last time to make sure the salt is right. Stir good 1 last time at let cook 15 minutes."
- "While the tomatoes are cooking the last 15 minutes, start water boiling in 2 more pots. These will be used to heat your jars and lids, so they will seal."
- "Carefully remove your jar from the boiling water. Make sure all the water is out. Place your funnel in the jar and scoop out a cup of tomatoes. Do not remove the heat from the tomatoes."
- "Fill the jar up. Remove any air bubbles you see with a small spoon."
- "Clean off the top of the jar with a clean DAMP cloth."
- "Carefully remove the lid from the water. Make sure the water is totally drained. Tighten the lid all the way down on the jar. Be sure the lid is not cross threaded and sits all the way down."
- "Place the jar on an even flat surface. You will hear clicking as the jars seal. You will usually hear this within 10-15 minutes depending on the temp of the lid when it was applied. The jars should vot touch each other on the sureface"
- "Wait 36 hours before moving to storage. Can should in a cool dry place on a level surface."
