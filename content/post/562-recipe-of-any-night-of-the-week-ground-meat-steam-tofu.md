Silken tofu is best used in this recipe. Otherwise, medium or hard tofu may also be used. Some other common ingredients for the tofu with minced pork recipe include fermented soybean paste and broad bean paste, both render a much stronger savory taste. Other commonly used ingredients are dry Chinese mushrooms, Chinese pickles, and french beans. I like to include some Chinese pickles, which will give a sharp contrast to the subtle taste of the meat.
