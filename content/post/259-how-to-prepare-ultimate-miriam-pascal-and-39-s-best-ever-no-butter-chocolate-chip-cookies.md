recipeingredient:
- "1 cup vegetable oil"
- "1 cup brown sugar"
- "1/2 cup granulated sugar"
- "2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 tsp baking soda"
- "2 eggs"
- "2 tbsp cornstarch"
- "2 1/2 cup flour"
- "1 1/2 cup chocolate chips"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 375°. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside."
- "In a stand mixer, beat together the oil and sugars until smooth and creamy."
- "Add the vanilla, baking soda, eggs, and cornstarch, beating well to combine after each addition. Add flour and beat until just combined. Add chocolate chips and stir to combine."
- "Scoop the dough using a medium cookie scoop (or a heaping tablespoon) onto prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8-9 minutes, until the tops are set. Do not overbake!"
- "When removing from oven, set aside to cool off for 1 or 2 minutes. Then use a spatula and put them on several wire racks. Wait a while until the cookies are completely cooled to store them."
- "***Sidenotes: If you don&#39;t have a stand mixer, you can probably use a hand mixer or mix it by hand but it&#39;ll be more work. Also, I bought a small cookie scoop and it yields more cookies out of it. Lastly, I &#39;double team&#39; when taking them out of the oven. Since it can yield 50 cookies, once a cookie sheet comes out of the oven, the next goes in. I let it cool for a minute and put on the wire racks then change the parchment paper and start putting the next batch on that sheet to get ready to put into the oven when the current batch comes out."
