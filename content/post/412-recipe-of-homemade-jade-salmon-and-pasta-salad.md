Pasta salads are a must during the summer. You can throw all your favourite salad ingredients in to a bowl with some freshly cooked pasta and flaked grilled salmon and bring it all together with a sweet and zesty dressing. This is a great dish to feed a crowd, which is why we always make a big batch for a BBQ. The salad leaves bring some freshness and a bit of crunch, together with the tomatoes, and they contrast well with the pasta and salmon. You can go for any pasta shape, if really does not matter which one, although I think this shape is pretty cool for salads, for pasta dishes with sauce I usually go for fussilli or spaghetti.
