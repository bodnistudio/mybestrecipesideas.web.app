recipeinstructions:
- "Orange and mascarpone filling - put the mascarpone in a bowl, add the juice and rind of 1 orange and mix the mixture with a fork well. Add the sugar to the mix and incorporate well. Add more if you like it sweeter."
- "Melt the white chocolate in the microwave. This will be used for the topping. Grate some orange rind as a garnish and keep it in a bowl."
- "Pipe the mascarpone mixture into the choux pastry. Please see my recipe for choux pastry on my cookpad. Once the mixture is filled in the choux, take a teaspoon of the melted white chocolate and cover the top of the eclair. While it is still melted, sprinkle some orange rind on top as a decoration. This eclair is now done!"
- "Pomegranate and dark chocolate filling - firstly make a pomegranate coulis. Take the fresh pomegranate seeds and 10 grams of sugar and bring to a boil in a pan. As the pomegranate starts to release some liquid, add in the cornstarch and keep stirring. When this coulis is ready, strain the seeds out and keep the liquid in a bowl and let it cool down. I put it in a bowl of cold water to cool it down faster."

- "In a separate bowl, melt the dark chocolate for topping and keep some fresh pomegranate seeds in a bowl for the garnish. Pipe the pomegranate cream into the empty eclairs and then cover the top of the eclairs with dark chocolate and while it is still runny, add a few fresh pomegranate seeds to garnish."
- "Spiced coffee filling - make a thick coffee paste by adding a little bit of water to the instant coffee. Add the cardamom and cinnamon to the paste. Let this paste cool down."
- "With an electric whisk, whisk the double cream, sugar and coffee mixture together until it forms soft peaks. Add more sugar if you prefer it sweeter."
- "In a separate bowl, melt some milk chocolate. Pipe the mixture into the empty eclairs and cover the tops of the eclairs with the milk chocolate. While it is still runny, sprinkle some chopped pistachios as a garnish."
