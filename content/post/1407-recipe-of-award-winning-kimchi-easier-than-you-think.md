recipeingredient:
- " Napa cabbage cut into roughly 1x 2 pieces about 30 cups of chopped raw cabbage"
- " green onions washed roots trimmed and cut into 2 inch segments"
- " kosher salt about 10 less if youre using regular table salt"
- " For the paste"
- " minced garlic about 5 or 6 large cloves"
- " minced fresh ginger root about a 2 segment peeled"
- " crushed red chili flakes depending on how hot you want your kimchi See notes above re gochugaru"
- " steamed white rice lightly packed Short or long grain is fine If stale microwave with 2 Tbsp water for 1 minute"
- " fish sauce"
- " sugar"
- " water for blending  13 cup water for rinsing seasoning from bowl see directions below"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large stainless steel or mixing bowl, toss the raw cabbage, green onion, and the salt together to pre-brine the cabbage. Make sure to thoroughly incorporate the salt throughout the cabbage. In 10 to 15 minutes, you should start to see the cabbage leach liquid and wilt. Let the cabbage sit for 1.5 to 2 hours, tossing and redistributing every 30 minutes to ensure even brining."
- "After at least 90 minutes of pre-brining, rinse the cabbage with enough water to cover the cabbage by 4 or 5 inches by swishing the cabbage in the water 7 or 8 times. Remove the cabbage into a strainer and let the excess water drain while you prepare the paste."
- "Make the paste by putting all the paste ingredients into a blender and blend until you can&#39;t see the individual grains of rice. Pour the paste over the cabbage."
- "Get into the bowl with your hands and mix the paste into the cabbage until all the pieces are evenly and thoroughly coated."
- "Pack your kimchi into a clean, dry bottle or other tight-lidded container (this time I repurposed a half gallon kimchi jar) and use the last 1/3 cup of water to swish around the mixing bowl, pick up all the remaining paste, and pour that liquid on top of your kimchi. Remember to leave 2 to 3 inches of headspace at the top to allow for expansion as fermentation takes place."
- "Your batch of kimchi is now ready for fermentation in a dark but not cold place like the inside of your cupboard. Or, if you can find a warmish spot in your garage, you can put it there. (I know that&#39;s not always possible for cold climate people in the middle of winter.) As it ripens, it&#39;s a good idea keep the lid slightly unscrewed to relieve the pressurization caused by fermentation. (Your jar can literally explode from the pressure on a specially active fermentation day.)"
- "People often ask HOW RIPE DOES THE KIMCHI HAVE TO BE BEFORE I REFRIGERATE OR EAT IT? You can eat the kimchi whenever you want. Fresh, just after it&#39;s been made, all the way up to when it&#39;s so incredibly old, ripe and stinky you could choke out a subway system by placing an open jar in one of the vents. It remains safe for human consumption for A VERY LONG TIME."
- "But as to when to refrigerate, just go out once a day every day to taste a piece, and when it gets to the ripeness you like, stick it in the fridge. It&#39;ll continue to ripen, but very slowly."
- "Enjoy! :)"

Hey everyone, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, kimchi (easier than you think! ;) ). One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Kimchi (Easier than you think! ;) ) is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It is easy, it is fast, it tastes delicious. It is enjoyed by millions every day. Kimchi (Easier than you think! ;) ) is something which I've loved my entire life. They're nice and they look wonderful.

Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish of fermented vegetables and spices, in particular ginger, garlic, peppers and hot chilies. Kimchi: AKA fermented cabbage, is one of the healthiest foods for your gut. Chef Randy Feltis shares how to make the dish yourself.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook kimchi (easier than you think! ;) ) using 11 ingredients and 9 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Kimchi (Easier than you think! ;) ):

1. Prepare  green onions, washed, roots trimmed, and cut into 2 inch segments
1. Get  kosher salt (about 10% less if you&#39;re using regular table salt)
1. Get  For the paste:

Traditional Korean kimchi is wonderful, but it requires more complex steps and ingredients that are harder to source. I wanted to make this doable for the average American. Some kimchi recipes call for raw oysters and raw squid. How would these stay fresh for weeks and months, I wondered?

So, making kimchi was just one of those things I avoided. I made kimchi last week, and it has been sitting in on my kitchen floor for three days. The problem is, it will NOT (If someone has knowledge about kimchi-chem…) but I think it would be easier to start over… you put sugar in the kimchi-paste? enough gochugaru. Epidemiological evidence that kimchi consumption may significantly increase cancer risk. I think you should search and find out more information. 

So that's going to wrap it up for this exceptional food kimchi (easier than you think! ;) ) recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I am confident you can make this at home.
