I also fried the bacon first, then removed it from the pan and fried my onion, celery and shredded carrot in the bacon fat. Heat butter and oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until butter starts to sizzle, then reduce heat to medium. In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions, carrots and celery and cook, stirring. This Bolognese sauce is dedicated to the late great Marcella Hazan.
