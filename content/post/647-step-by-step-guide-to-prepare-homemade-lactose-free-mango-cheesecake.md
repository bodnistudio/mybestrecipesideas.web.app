It is gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free, no-sugar-added, and can be vegan. I have such strong childhood memories of my mom making her strawberry cheesecake as a dessert for her dinner parties. It was a recipe she got from her sister and I can literally taste it in my mouth as I type this! Obviously it was loaded with dairy and sugar so its off the menu for Mila and I. A lot of dessert recipes call for your standard carton of milk, and more often than not, nowadays more and more recipes are adhering to different dietary restrictions.
