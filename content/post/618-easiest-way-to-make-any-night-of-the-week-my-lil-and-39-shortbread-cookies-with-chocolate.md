recipeinstructions:
- "Brown Butter-Â  My family gets excited when I&#39;m using that fancy French wordÂ  -beurre noisette-Â  Means mom&#39;s making her Little Shortbread Cookies!Â  And why you ask, because it adds a deep, nutty flavor to myO cookies! ðŸ’šÂ  ToÂ make brown butterÂ  simply start meltingÂ butter over medium heat.  We use grass fed cow butter...no gmo&#39;s. Please only use real butter people, stop outting chemicals in your awesome bodies!  Use a pan with a light-colored bottom so you can keep track of the color.  I used my favorite old kitchen witch spoon, I like to add in some love &amp; magic."
- "Making the Cookie Dough-Â  Grab a nice sized bowl &amp; add your 1 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of sugar. I used an old potato masher to cream my butter and sugar.Â  Stir in brown butter, vanilla &amp; salt.  By the way if your lucky enough or flippin spoiled and have a Kitchen Aid Mixer then super awesome.Â  Yeah, I&#39;m jealous.Â  I don&#39;t have one...- So I workout my guns!  Now start by adding your flour- Just a half a cup at a time.Â  It&#39;s a shortbread cookie- so expect a sandy texture to your cookie mix.Â  No Worries."
- "Forming the Cookie Dough-Â  I could not find my plastic wrap, so I grabbed a large baggie, cut out the seams, then used it to form my shortbread cookies.Â  It was fun, kinda like Play-Doh.Â  Thou next time I&#39;m going to roll them out and use cookie cutters Cut then about 1/2 inch or less.Â  Place on a cookie sheet.Â  Bake at 350Â° for about 12 to 15 minutes.Â  Place your bad-ass cookies on a cooling rack."
- "My Chocolate Filling-Â  Grab another bowl and add 1 stick of butter (room temp.), 1/2 cup of shortening, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla (used my homemade vanilla)."
- "Mix and blend well....Again with the KitchenAid Mixer or just my two little hands.Â  Used a rubber spatula to spoon the filling into baggie with a icing tip.Â  Just pipe it onto each shortbread cookie."
- "Time to add the Naughty Chocolate Filling-Â  Glab a baggie fill it with your filling/ frosting, cut the tip off just a tiny bit, give the baggie a whirl- a bit of a squeeze and then your filling will come outÂ  No need for fancy pastry bags and tips. Sit back, enjoy the view and have a cookie or 2! ðŸ’š"
