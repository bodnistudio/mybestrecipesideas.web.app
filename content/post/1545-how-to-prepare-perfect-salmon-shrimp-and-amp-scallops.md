It&#39;s garlicky, sweet and sticky with simple ingredients. Salmon is my go - to seafood, but I wanted to bring a little bit of a local flavor to really shake things up. There is nothing like local fresh Gulf shrimp to take any recipe to the next level. With lemon butter sauce and vegetable rice pilaf.

Directions For salmon, Pink, Chartreuse and Purple Fire Dye are my favorites. I like to thaw them out first, rather than use frozen bait. And, I don&#39;t like them wet, so I&#39;ll let them dry out first before I dye. The salmon takes on a light, smoky woodiness from grilling on a cedar plank, for a lovely pairing of earth and ocean. Eat it all with your hands, discarding shrimp tails and pepper stems as you go.
