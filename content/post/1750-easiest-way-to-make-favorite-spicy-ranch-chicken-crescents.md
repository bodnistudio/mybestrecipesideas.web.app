If you like Buffalo chicken, then you are going to LOVE this party-ready version. Buttery crescents are baked around a savory, spicy, creamy filling no one can resist‚Äîand because it&#39;s Buffalo chicken, of course we&#39;re going to suggest you dip it in ranch. Every swirl is stuffed with creamy ranch dressing, crispy bacon, melty cheddar cheese and buttery crescents for a bite-size snack that boasts big flavors. I decided to start off my spree with this crunchy chicken salad because it&#39;s fun, easy, and delicious! Of course I couldn&#39;t eat just salad; I wanted a little more out of it, so I added some breaded chicken and spiced it up with some Spicy ranch dressing.
