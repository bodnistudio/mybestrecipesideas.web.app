SOME BODY TOUCHA MY SPAGHETTI Spaghetti Sauce. This spaghetti sauce recipe may be the first thing I learned to cook, completely by myself, when I was really young. As I got better at cooking and baking (and because I loved it so much) I can specifically remember two recipes my Mom would let me make all by myself: this homemade spaghetti sauce, and our family&#39;s favorite Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies. Spaghetti was always one of my favorite foods growing up. And my mom made them both regularly.
