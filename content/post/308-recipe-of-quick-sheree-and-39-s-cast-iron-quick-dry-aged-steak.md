If you&#39;ve never cooked steak before, it can be a little intimidating. Dry aged meats require very specific conditions in order to do their thing, and you can only properly dry age larger sub-primal cuts, not individual steaks (you can read the article to learn why). What the home-fridge method does is dry brine the meat, or as I like to call it, deep season it. A cast-iron pan holds and retains heat especially well, helping to brown the steak more evenly. A wet aged steak shows some improvement over a standard non-aged steak in terms of tenderness—there are enzymes present in the meat that will break down tough connective tissue over time.
