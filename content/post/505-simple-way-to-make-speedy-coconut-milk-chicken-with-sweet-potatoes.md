By cooking the curry under pressure allowed the coconut milk and sweet potato to combine in a thick sweet and creamy sauce. I am very happy with this unique curry recipe. Add the sweet potatoes, coconut milk, Thai curry paste, salt, pepper, and stir to combine. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.
