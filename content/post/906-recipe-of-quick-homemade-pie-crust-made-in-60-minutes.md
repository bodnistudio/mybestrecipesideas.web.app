<h3>Instructions to make Homemade Pie Crust Made In 60 Minutes:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Dice the butter into 1 - 2 cm cubes. Measure the milk and place in the refrigerator. Put the flour into a bowl and add the diced butter..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Smash the butter into the flour using the back of a spoon. It&#39;s okay if it doesn&#39;t mix all together. Time is crucial! This step takes about 1 - 2 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add the milk and mix in gently without kneading. When it looks clumpy and grainy like the picture, then it&#39;s good to go..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Just like that, wrap it in plastic wrap, form it into a square, and chill in the freezer for 20-30 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Dust with flour and use a rolling pin to stretch out the crust. It will break and split in places, but don&#39;t worry about that. The first time you roll it out, if it looks broken up like in the photo, it&#39;s fine..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			It&#39;s more or less fine to leave the breaks there. Forcibly fold the dough three times over itself. Dust with more flour, and roll out with a rolling pin again. You should repeat this step 5 - 6 times..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			If the dusted flour depletes and/or the butter melts too much, place in the freezer for 20 minutes to chill, then try again. If the room temperature is 28°C, you can make it to the end without resting..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Roll out the crust to 5 mm thick, sprinkle the surface with sugar and make into your preferred shape. Bake for 13 - 15 minutes at 210°C, and then it&#39;s finished..
			
			
		</li>
	
</ol>

<p>
	
		Gradually add the milk, tossing with a fork until a ball is formed.
	
		Don&#39;t be afraid to use it as a homemade crust for pot pie, quiche, and even cinnamon rolls.
	
		Cinnamon sugar rolls with left over dough, which by the way, is the best part of making your own pie crust.
	
		Is it a good idea to make pie crust using a stand mixer?
	
		Or is it really better to combine all of the ingredients — the flour and salt, fat and water — by hand?
