<h3>Steps to make Nessa&#39;s Apple Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Made with fresh apples and topped with a sweet vanilla glaze.             Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position and Preheat oven to 500ºF.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place diced apples in a large mixing bowl | Add vanilla &amp; lemon juice and toss to coat | In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon sugar | Pour flour mixture over apples and toss until evenly coated.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Roll first pie crust dough into a 13x9&#34; rectangle on a lightly floured surface | Transfer dough into the bottom of an ungreased 13x9&#34; baking dish by placing a rolling pin in the center of the dough, folding one side up over the pin, then folding the other side on top | Lift the rolling pin over the baking dish and unfold both sides into the dish.
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Carefully dump apples over the crust and spread them evenly  around the edge of the crust | Cut stick of butter in tabs and lay evenly over apples | Roll out the 2nd pie crust dough in the same manner about ½&#34; larger on each side | Transfer dough over apples and tuck/roll sides of dough down/around into the baking dish, sealing the apples inside the crust | Use a Fork to crimp down the edges l Poke fork for vent holes in the top of the pie crust..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			In a small bowl, warm the milk in microwave for 45 sec and brush over top of the pie | Topping: Combine the sugars in another small bowl add cold butter use fork to crumble togther, sprinkle evenly over pie and then sprinkle cinnamon sugar over entire pie..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Carefully place the pie in the oven then reduce the temperature to 425°F. Bake at this temperature until the top crust is golden brown. This should take 20-25 minutes. (I like to set a timer for 20 minutes and check at that point.)Once the top is golden brown, rotate the baking sheet, and turn the temperature down to 375°F. Bake another 30-35 minutes, until the top crust is a deep golden brown. Remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool 1 hour before putting the glaze on..
