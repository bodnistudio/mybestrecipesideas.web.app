Jack made a version of this Mediterranean pasta salad several years ago - but he&#39;s taken the flavors up several notches in this recipe! It&#39;s an easy pasta salad with classic Mediterranean ingredients - garlic, olives, tomatoes, peppers, artichokes and feta cheese, plus basil and mint for some additional fresh flavor. A simple Mediterranean pasta salad loaded with fresh arugula, sun-dried tomatoes, marinated artichoke hearts, pine nuts, kalamata olives, basil pesto and so much more! It&#39;s a copy-cat recipe for Cafe Express&#39;s Pasta Amore and let me just say it&#39;s actually BETTER!
