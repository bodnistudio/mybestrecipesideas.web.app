<h3>Steps to make Turkey and Dumplings Pot Pie:</h3>

<ol>
	
		<li>
			Melt butter over medium heat. Once butter is melted add minced garlic and saut√© for 5 minutes, then add turkey and onion. Mix well for another 5 minutes..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Next, stir in flour, terragon, salt, and pepper. Mix well..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Add milk and heavy whipping cream. Stir until milk sauce thickens..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Stir in wine, peas and carrots. Stir until all ingredients are incorporated and warm. Take one of the pastry shells and create bite sized balls for the dumplings. You decide on the size, but not too big otherwise you&#39;ll take away from the pie..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Place 2 of the pie pastry at bottom of baking dish for bottom crust then pour turkey mixture on top..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Use last 3 pie pastry to create top layer of pot pie. Make sure you seal the edges good otherwise it will leak out while baking. I put a cookie sheet underneath the casserole dish just in case the juices leak out, it will not go to the bottom of the oven and burn..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Bake at 475 for 45 minutes or until crust is brown..
			
			
		</li>
	
		<li>
			Let cool for 10 minutes, serve and enjoy!.
