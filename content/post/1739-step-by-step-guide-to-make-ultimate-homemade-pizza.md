- "Brown the pork, when it is halfway done add the onions. Once the onions and meat are nearly done, add the mushrooms and stir all the toppings are heated through. Grab a strainer (I generally line my sink with paper towels first) then poor the toppings in to drain the grease, let that sit for a bit till it is cool enough to handle.While you are waiting add your sauce to your crust first by pouring in the middle then working out to the edges with a spoon or spatula. Careful not to get any on the outside half inch, as any sauce not covered by toppings will burn. Then add your sausage topping mixture. Add the cheese. Bake for 18 to 20 mins or until crust becomes light brown and crispy.Make sure to let then pizza cool for about 5 mins before you cut."
