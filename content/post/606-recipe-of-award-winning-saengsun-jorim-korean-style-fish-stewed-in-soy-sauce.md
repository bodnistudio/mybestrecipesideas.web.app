recipeingredient:
- "1 (2 pound) fresh whole fish cleaned scaled and cut into thirds see notes above re using fish fillets"
- "1 large carrot peeled and cut into 12 thick pieces"
- "1/2 an onion cut into 14 thick slices"
- "4 cloves garlic peeled and smashed"
- "5 slices fresh ginger 18 thick"
- "4-5 jalapenos stemmed and halved"
- "1 tomato cut into sixths"
- "1 cup water"
- "3/4 cup soy sauce"
- "1-2 Tablespoons sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put everything in pot, with vegetables and aromatics going in first, under the fish. (This helps to keep the fish skin from sticking to the pot. I actually forgot to do it this time, but when most of my brain cells are functioning, I remember. ;) )"
- "Cover the pot, turn the heat up to medium high, and let everything come to a boil for a minute or two. This will probably take about 15 minutes. (I took the lid off to check the fish when I took this pic and forgot to put it back on.)"
- "Turn the heat down to medium low and simmer, covered, for another 15 minutes or so, the flip the fish and redistribute all the ingredients so they all get some immersed cooking time in the sauce."
- "Put lid on slightly askew and simmer another 15 minutes or so, then enjoy with a bowl of steamed rice. Even when the fish is all gone, I like to enjoy the slow cooked veg and flavorful sauce with rice for a quick and easy meal."
