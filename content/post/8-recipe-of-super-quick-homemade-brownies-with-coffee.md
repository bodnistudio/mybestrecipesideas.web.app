Am I coming off as opinionated? This is from the big bag of recipes my mother gave me. It uses instant coffee to give it the mocha flavor. In the original recipe it uses a double boiler to melt the chocolate but I have found that using the microwave is much quicker. If you love coffee, double the espresso powder in these amazing, moist and rich (yet super easy to make) brownies.
